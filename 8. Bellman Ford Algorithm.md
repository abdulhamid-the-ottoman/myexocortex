# Bellman Ford Algorithm

- Bellman-Ford(BF) algorithm is a Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithm.
- However BF is not ideal for most SSSP problems, because it has a time complexity of *O(E\*V)*.
	- Compared to Dijsktra O(E+log(V)), it is really slow.
- So when do we use the Bellman Ford algorithm?
	- Dijsktra's algorithm can fail when the graph has negative edge weights.
	- This is when BF becomes really handy, because it can be used to 
		- **detect negative cycles**
		- and **determine where the negative cycles occur.**
	- Finding negative cycles can be useful in many types of applications.
		- One particularly neat application arises in finance when performing an *arbitrage* between two or more markets.

## Negative Cycles
- Negative cycles can manifest themselves in many ways

### Example 1
-  As seen from the figure below, negative cycles can emerge as a result of a negative self-loop.
	![Pasted image 20230722060429.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722060429.png)
	- We can traverse the self loop infinite times, as a result we can have ever decreasing cost.
	- Nodes 2,3,4,5 are all reachable from node 1, so they all have a best of cost negative infinity with regards to SSSP.

### Example 2
- As seen from the figure below, this time negative cycle emerges through a cycle of nodes whose net gain is less than zero.
	![Pasted image 20230722061224.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722061224.png)
	- The net edge weight is. 1+4+(-6) = -1
	- You can see that the entire right side of the graph is affected by this negative cycle.

## BF Algorithm
- Let's define some variable
	- Let *E* be number of edges
	- Let *V* be the number of vertices
	- Let *S* be the number of the starting node.
	- Let *D* be an array of size *V* that tracks the best distance from *S* to each node

- Steps
	1. Set every entry in D to $+\infty$
	2. Set D\[S\] = 0
	3. Relax each edge V-1 times:
		- You know what relaxing means simply taking an edge and trying to update the value by comparing the distance of the source vertex + edge cost with the distance of destination of the edge and update the destination if needed.
		- In code,  
		  ```Julia
		  for(i = 0 ; i < V-1 ; i = i + 1)
			  for (edge in graph.edges)
				  if(D[edge.from] + edge.cost < D[edge.to])
					  D[edge.to] = D[edge.from] + edge.cost
				  end
			  end
		  end
	 	```
		- To **detect the negative cycles** , we don't do anything special. We just run the algorithm a second time.
			- This is for checking whether any node is updating to better value than the known best value and if they do, they are part of a negative cycle. 
			- And we mark that node with having the cost of $-\infty$
- Why?
	- How does it work?
		- Consider the algorithm as being divided into stages, 
			- where in the i-th stage, you discover the lowest cost path of i edges from the source to each vertex (for vertices reachable by a path of that length). 
			- The overall answer is then the lowest cost path to the destination among all the lengths. 
	       - What is the lowest cost path of i edges to a vertex V?
		       - cost(V, i) = min (cost(N, i-1) + edge_cost (N, V)) over all vertices N such that there exists an edge N->V and N was reachable by a path of size i-1.
			       - This is to say, pick all the vertices which have an edge to V and reachable with i-1 edges, then among those choose the minimum costly one to reach V.
			- This recurrence can solved by computing cost (V, i) for all V for i=1, then doing the same for i=2, etc.
			- You don't have to go beyond i=|V|-1 because that is the max number of edges in a cycle-free shortest path.
				-  every shortest path is necessarily cycle-free unless there's a negative-weight cycle.
			- The final answer is given by taking the min of cost(destination, i) over all i that had a path to the destination.
				- The space complexity is **O (|V| + |E|)** because that is the size of the input, and only O(|V|) extra space (for the distance array) beyond that is used, to maintain cost(V,i) and cost (V, i-1) for all V.
				- The time complexity is **O(|V|\*|E|)** because potentially all |E| edges might be processed in each of the |V| stages.
			
- SSSP Example:
	- Here we initialized our array D to $+\infty$
		![Pasted image 20230722084425.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722084425.png)
       - We set the start distance to zero, because we are already there.
	       ![Pasted image 20230722084537.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722084537.png)
	 - Now we can start relaxing the edges V-1 times. The most important thing is, the edges don't need to be chosen in any specific order.
		 - This means you can relax edges in any order you like.
			 - But you have to start from the start index, because if you start from the other nodes, your result won't mean anything because your source vertex dist is $+\infty$
		 - This means all the orders will give you the same end result distance table.
		 - Let's start with the yellow edge shown below
			![Pasted image 20230722084805.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722084805.png)
		 - We keep repeating, and after the first iteration, we have the following table shown below, but *you must be aware that there are 8 more iterations to go!*
			 ![Pasted image 20230722085740.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722085740.png)
		- After the second iteration, the distance table is shown below, don't forget there are *7 more iterations to go!*
			- Pay attention that in the distance array, there are few changes compared to the first iteration.
			![Pasted image 20230722085930.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722085930.png)
		- Let's fast-forward to the end. 
			- This was the SSSP part.  Now we can run the algorithm a second time to see there are negative cycles.
			![Pasted image 20230722090117.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722090117.png)

- Negative Cycle Example:
	 - Let's start relaxing edges again. 
	 - But this time, if are able to relax an edge, we will update the nodes value to $-\infty$
	 - Here we will only show the relaxable edges:
		  ![Pasted image 20230722111849.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722111849.png)
		  - Look at the yellow edge going from node 2 to node 3. Let's relax it.
			  - -20 (cost of node 2) + 10 (cost of edge) = -10 < -5 (cost of node 3), meaning this edge can be relaxed, so the destination of this edge node 3 is directly in the negative cycle.

	 - We can relax the edge from node 2 to node 4 as well.
		 - -20(cost of node 2) + 75 (cost of edge) < 60 , means it is relaxable, so we hit the destination with $-\infty$
		 ![Pasted image 20230722112859.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722112859.png)
		 - But pay attention, 4 is not directly in the loop. But it is reachable from the loop.
		 - In the code, there is no distinction between node 3 (directly in the negative cycle) and node 4 (reachable from the negative cycle)
		-  If you want to distinguish between 2 types of nodes, you can:
			1. Run BF(Bellman-Ford) over each strongly connected component (SCC), if a negative cycle is found in an SCC, then all nodes in that SCC belong to negative cycles.
			2. Run  BFS or DFS over any node in each SCC with a detected negative cycle. All the reachable nodes except the nodes found in (1) are reachable nodes.


	- We can relax the edge going from node 3 to node 2, we will see that it is relaxable
		- $-\infty$ + (-15) < -20 , so node 2 is directly in the negative cycle as well.
		![Pasted image 20230722122119.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722122119.png)
	- We can also relax the edge from node 4 to node 9, you can see that 
		 - $-\infty$ + 100 < 160 , so we can update node 9 value to $-\infty$
		 ![Pasted image 20230722122711.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722122711.png)

	 - Note that you have to repeat this for another 8 iterations in order to ensure the cycles fully propagate. 
		 - In this example, we happened to detect all cycles on the first iteration, but this was a coincidence.
