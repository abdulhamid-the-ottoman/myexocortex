# Building Abstractions with Procedures

## Intro Bulletins
- A computational process evolves to manipulate data.
- The evolution of a computational process is controlled by pattern of rules called a **program**
- Well-designed computational systems are **modular.**
- This book uses the Scheme dialect of Lisp
	- Lisp uses a certain kinds of logical expressions called *recursion equations*, as a model of computation.
- Lisp represents procedures as data (homo-iconity)
	- Lisp is an excellent language for writing programs that manipulates other programs as data such as compilers and interpreters.

## ‚ùì Questions
- What is model of computation?
	- A model of computation is a model which describes how an output of a *mathematical function* is computed given an input.
	- A model describes how units of computations, memories and communications are organized.
	- Models of computation can be classified into 3 categories: 
		- SEQUENTIAL MODELS:
			- Finite State Machines
			- Post machines ([Post-Turing Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%E2%80%93Turing_machine)  and [Tag system - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_system))
			- Pushdown automata
			- Register Machines
				- Random-access machines
			- Turing Machines
			- Decision Tree Model
		- FUNCTIONAL MODELS:
			- Abstract Rewriting Systems
			- Combinatory Logic
			- General Recursive Functions *LISP MODEL*
			- Lambda Calculus
		- CONCURRENT MODELS:
			- Actor model
			- Cellular automaton
			- Interaction nets
			- Kahn process networks
			- Logic gates and digital circuits
			- Petri Nets
			- Synchronous Data Flow
- What is a procedure?
	- Lisp descriptions of processes are called procedures.
- What does modular mean?
	-  A modular system is a collection of building blocks that can be configured in different ways, adapting for different customer needs
