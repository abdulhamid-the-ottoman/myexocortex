# Beginning Student Language - Part B

## Learning Goals
- Be able to use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design functions that operate on primitive data.¬†
- Be able to read a complete function design and identify its different elements.
- Be able to evaluate the different elements for clarity, simplicity and consistency with each other.
- Be able to evaluate the entire design for how well it solves the given problem.

## HtDF Recipe
- The HtDF recipe systematizes the design of a function.
- It helps us what to do, and it also helps us be sure that we end up with a high quality function.
	- it really does what we need it to do,
	- and that's been well-tested
- Design recipes let us take a big hard problem and break it down and work through it in a systematic fashion.
	- The price we pay for that is it actually makes easy problems cumbersome.

### Steps
 1. Signature, Purpose and Stub
 2. Define examples, wrap each in check-expect
 3. Template and inventory
 4. Code the function body
 5. Test and debug until correct

#### Notes
- Each of these steps build on the ones that precede it.
	- The signature helps you write the purpose, the stub and the check-expects
	- The signature also helps you code the body
	- The purpose helps you write the check-expects and code the body
	- The stub helps you write the check expects
	- The check-expects help you code the body as well as to test the complete design.
- It is sometimes helpful to do the steps in different order. 
	- Sometimes it is easier to write examples first, then do the signature and purpose.
	- Often at some point during the design, you may discover an issue or boundary condition you didn't anticipate, at that point go back and update the purpose and examples accordingly
	- But you should never write the function definition first and then go back and do the other recipe elements.
- Throughout the HtDF process, be sure to "run early and run often". 
	- Run your program whenever it is well-formed
	- The more often you press run the sooner you can find mistakes
	- Finding mistakes one at a time is much easier than waiting until later when the mistakes can compound and more confusing.

## Step 1: Signature, Purpose and Stub
- Steps involved:
	- Write the function signature
	- A one-line purpose statement
	- A function stub
- A *signature* has the type of each argument, separated by spaces, followed by ->, followed by the type of result.
	- So a function that consumes an image and produces a number would have the signature **Image -> Number**
- The *stub* is a syntactically complete function definition that produces a value of the right type.
	- If the type is Number, then it is common to use 0.
	- If the type is String, it is common to use "a"
	- The value will not, in general, match the purpose statement.
	- Here is an example:
```Scheme
		;; Number -> Number     (Signature)
		;; produces n times 2   (Purpose)
		(define (double n) 0)   ;(Stub)
```
- The purpose of the stub is to serve as a kind of scaffolding to make it possible to run the examples even before the function design is complete.
	- With the stub in place, check-expects that call the function can run.
	- Most of them will fail of course, but the fact that they can run at all allows you to ensure that they are at least well-formed:
		- parentheses are balanced
		- function calls have the proper number of arguments
		- function and constant names are correct and so on.
	- The sooner you find a mistake -- even a simple one -- the easier to fix.

## Step 2: Define examples and wrap each one in check-expect.
- Write at least one example of a call to the function and the expected result the call should produce.
- You will often need more examples, to help you better understand the function or to properly test the function.
	- If once your function works and you run the program some of the code is *highlighted in black*, it means you definitely do not have enough examples.
	- If you are unsure how to start writing examples use the combination of the function signature and the data definition(s) to help you generate examples.
	- Often the example data from the data definition is useful, but it doesn't necessarily cover all the important cases for a particular function.
