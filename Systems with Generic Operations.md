# Systems with Generic Operations
- In [Representations for Complex Numbers](./Representations%20for%20Complex%20Numbers.md), we saw how to create operations that work on multiple data representations.
- We can extend this further to create operations that are generic over different kinds of arguments, not just different representations of the same kind of data
	- we can do it over complex, rational and normal numbers all together
- We will develop a general arithmetic system using data-directed programming that works on several kinds of numbers.
