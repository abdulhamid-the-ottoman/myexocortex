# Shortest - Longest path on a DAG

## Brush-up on DAGs
- DAG is a graph with directed edges and no cycles.
	- By definition, this means all trees are automatically DAGs since they don't contain cycles.
- Examples:

## SSSP on DAG
- The **Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP)** problem can be solved efficiently on a DAG in *O(V+E) time*
	- This is due to the fact that the nodes can be ordered in a *topological ordering* via topo-sort and processed sequentially.
	- Since shortest path between source vertex and a particular vertex should involve minimum intermediate edges hence finding topo-sort first for computing shortest path makes sense because topological sort arranges the vertices in increasing order of their in-degree.
- Here, after edge relaxation process (visiting all the outgoing edges and updating the min distance accordingly)
	- Instead of choosing the most promising one, what we do is , we take the next node from the topological ordering.
- One thing to note here is , here the edges can include negative weights, because we have  a pre-determined ordering of nodes.

## Longest Path on DAG

- What about the longest path?
	- On a general graph, this problem is **NP-HARD**
	- But on a DAG, this problem is solvable in O(V+E) // linear time.
- The technique is
	- to multiply all edge values by -1.
	- then find the shortest path
	- then multiply the edges by -1 again.
- Here is an example:
	- Let's multiply all the edges with -1.

    - Find the shortest path and then multiply the distance with -1 again
