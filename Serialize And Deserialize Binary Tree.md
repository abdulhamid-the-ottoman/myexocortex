# 🌍 Problem Definition

> [!QUESTION] Problem
> -  Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
> 
> - Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
> 
>-  **Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011883654-What-does-1-null-2-3-mean-in-binary-tree-representation-). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
> - `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`


## 🔑 **Key Points of Understanding**
- You can do it in storing it in both `inorder` and `postorder` orders and reconstructing.
