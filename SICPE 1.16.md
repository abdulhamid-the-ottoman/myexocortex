# 🌍 Problem Definition

> [!QUESTION] Problem
> Design a procedure that evolves an iterative exponentiation process that uses successive squaring and uses a logarithmic number of steps, as does `fast-expt`. (Hint: Using the observation that $(b^{n/2})^2$ = $(b^2)^{n/2}$, keep, along with the exponent n and the base b, an additional state variable a, and define the state transformation in such a way that the product $ab^n$ is unchanged from state to state. At the beginning of the process a is taken to be 1, and the answer is given by the value of a at the end of the process. In general, the technique of defining an _invariant quantity_ that remains unchanged from state to state is a powerful way to think about the design of iterative algorithms.)
