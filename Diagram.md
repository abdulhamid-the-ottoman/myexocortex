# ðŸ’  Use Cases
## Definitions
- A use case describes **what** your system **does** to accomplish a **particular customer goal.**
	- Use cases are all about the "what".
		- what does the system need to do in order to capture background information?
		- Remember don't worry about the "how" right now.
	- We're still definitely focusing on what the system needs to "do"
		- What should happen in order to get "Daily Salah Information"
	 - A single use case focuses on a single goal.
		 - When 30 mins after adhan is passed, the system needs to send a reminder text message.
		 - If you want to track how many times a person prayed on time, you'd need another, different use case.
	- The user (or users) are outside of the system not a part of it. You as a customer has a goal for the system and you are also outside of the system.
	- The customer goal is the point of the use case:
		- what do all these steps need to make happen?
		- we are focusing on the customer, remember?
		- The system has to help that customers accomplish their goals.
- A use case has 3 parts:
	- **Clear Value:** Every use case must have a *clear value* to the system.
		- If the use case doesn't help the customer achieve their goal, then the use case isn't of much use
	- **Start and Stop:** Every use case must have a definite *starting* and *stopping* point.
		- Something must begin the process and there there must be a condition that indicates the process is complete.
	- **External Initiator:** Every use case is started off by an *external initiator, outside of the system.*
		- Sometimes that initiator is a person, but it could be anything outside of the system.
