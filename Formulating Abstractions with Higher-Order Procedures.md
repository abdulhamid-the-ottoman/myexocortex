# Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures

## Intro

> [!INFO] Procedures as abstractions
>- We have seen that procedures are, in effect, abstractions that describe compound operations on numbers independent of particular numbers.
>- We don't calculate the  square of 2, we abstract the idea of squaring any number into a procedure

> [!INFO] Building abstractions by assigning names
>-  One of the things we should demand from a powerful programming language is the ability to build abstractions by assigning names to common patterns and then to work in terms of the abstractions directly
> - Such as the case the case with square procedure is named as square  and used over and over again.

- Procedures operating on numbers are powerful, but we can go further.
- To abstract more general programming patterns, we need to write procedures that take other procedures as arguments and return new procedures.
	- These are called higher-order procedures.
