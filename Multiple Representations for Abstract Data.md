# Multiple Representations for Abstract Data

- Data abstraction lets us write programs that work independently of the chosen representation for data objects.
	- This helps us control the complexity
- But it's not powerful enough.
	- sometimes we want not just an abstracted underlying representation, but multiple representation.
- In addition to horizontal abstraction barriers, separating high-level from low-level, 
	- we also need vertical abstraction barriers, allowing multiple design choices to co-exist.
- We'll do this by constructing generic procedures, which can operate on data that may be represented in more than one way.
