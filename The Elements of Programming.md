# The Elements of Programming
- There are 3 mechanisms for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas found in every powerful programming language:
	- **primitive expressions**
	- **means of combination**
	- **means of abstraction**
- Programming deals with **procedures** and **data** (which are almost the same thing in Lisp)
- Procedures manipulate data

	- *Combination* is one or more elements selected from a set without regard to the order of selection.
	- *Composition* is applying a function to the result of another.
