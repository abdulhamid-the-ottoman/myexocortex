# Building Abstractions with Data
- In [Building Abstractions with Procedures](./Building%20Abstractions%20with%20Procedures.md) chapter, we wrote procedures that operated on simple numerical data.
- In this chapter we are going to look at more complex data.

> [!INFO] Goal
>  Just as the ability to define procedures enables to deal with processes at a higher conceptual level than that of primitive operations of the language, the ability to construct compound data objects enables us to deal with data at a higher conceptual level than that of the primitive data objects of the language.

- Consider functions dealing with rational numbers:
	- Only being able to return one number is awkward.
	- This is where compound data objects become useful.

- Data abstraction separates representation from use. 
	- It enables us to construct abstraction barriers between different parts of the program.
