# Introduction to Data Abstraction

- We already know about *procedural abstraction*, which suppresses implementation details by treating procedures as black boxes.
- Data abstractions allow us to isolate how a compound data object is used from the details of its actual representation.

> [!INFO] The Goal
>  - Our programs should use data in such a way as to make no assumptions about data that are *not strictly necessary* for performing the task at hand.
> 	 - We are only concerned about task at hand

- There is a concrete data representation behind the abstraction
- The interface is made up of procedures called *constructors* and *selectors*
