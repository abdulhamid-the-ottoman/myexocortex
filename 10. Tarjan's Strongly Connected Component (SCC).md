# Tarjan's Strongly Connected Component (SCC)

## What are SCCs?
- Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) can be thought of as *self-contained cycles* within a *directed graph* where every vertex in a given cycle can reach every other vertex in the same cycle.
	- Here you can see there are 4 SCCs shown in different colors.
	- Pay attention for each component , **there is no way to find a path that leaves a component and comes back** (being self-contained)
		- Because of this property we can be sure that SCC's in a graph are unique.
		- That's why we can use them for *contraction of the graph* to be faster in other algorithms. (less nodes)

## Properties of Nodes
- Every node has 2 properties :  **Index and Low-link**
	- **index** : we assign an integer to the nodes consecutively in the order they are visited by DFS.
	- **low-link**: the smallest index of any node known to be reachable from node v
- Case 1:  **v.lowlink = v.index**
	- This is the case where there is no backward edge to any other node.
	- The current node is the root of a SCC provided that we have visited all its neighbors
- Case 2:  **v.lowlink < v.index**
	- We have found a *backward edge*
	- You already know how to find a backward edge from DFS implementation.

## A Deeper Look Into Low-Link Values
- The **low-link** value of a node is the smallest *(lowest)* node id reachable from that node when doing a DFS. (including itself)
- Here is our graph un-labelled:
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723160754.png)
- Here we ran the DFS on it to label the nodes: (starting from node 0)
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723161223.png)

- For example, low-link of node 1 is 0 because node 0 is the node with lowest ID reachable from node 1.
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723161414.png)

- Similarly,  for node 3, it is 2.
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723161532.png)

- Finally for the final configuration, we end up with the following low-link values
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723161627.png)

- From this view, you realize that all nodes which have the same loading value belong to the same strongly connected component.
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723161904.png)
	 - Seems a little too easy, there must be something wrong with this.!
	 - You are right, there is a catch, **the flaw with this technique is that it is highly dependent on the traversal order of the DFS which is effectively random**.

 - A counter example:
	 - Here is the same graph , traversal order of the DFS is changed.
			![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723162318.png)
		-  Started DFS on the node 0, resumed DFS at node 2 , and then resumed DFS at node 4 to finish labelling all nodes in the graph.
	- Now let's have a look at node 6, there is a path from 6 to zero. 
			![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723162701.png)
		 - According to this, 6 is part of strongly connected components of node zero.
		 - Which we know it is not the case!!!
	- However this is not the only issue, all the low-link values are the same, and but clearly there are multiple separate strongly connected components.

## Tarjan's Algorithm
- What went wrong with the counter example above? 
	- Depending on where the DFS starts, and the order in which nodes/edges are visited, the low-link values for identifying SCCs could be wrong.
- What does Tarjan do to fix this?
	- **Tarjan maintains an invariant that prevents SCCs to interfere with the low link value of other SCCs.**
### Stack Invariant
- To cope with the random traversal order of the DFS, Tarjan's algorithm *maintains a stack (set) of valid nodes from which to update low-link values.*
- When DFS recursively visits a node v and its descendants -> 
	- in the case of tarjan's algorithm, those nodes are not necessarily popped off the stack when the call returns.
	- A node remains on the stack after it has been visited **if there exists a path in the graph from this node to some node earlier on the stack, meaning there is a back-edge**
- So at the end of the call that visits v:
	- We know whether v itself has a path to any node earlier on the stack:
		- **YES** : **v** has a path to any node earlier on the stack, **then the call returns and v stays on the stack**
		- **NO**: **v** does not have a path to any node earlier on the stack, then the node *v* must be the root of its strongly connected component.

### Overview of the Algorithm
- Mark the id of each node as unvisited (Normal DFS)
- Start DFS:
	- Upon visiting a node assign it an id(index) and a low-link value.
	- Also mark current nodes as visited and add them to a seen stack.
- On DFS call back, *after the recursive call comes back:*
	- If we found a back-edge and back-edge's destination is currently on the stack., then we start *min process*(updating the low-link value).
	- We continue this min process until we hit a node whose index is equal to the index of that node.
	- This will essentially allow the low-link values to propagate through cycles, meaning we don't pop off any element until we find the root(a node where *lowlink = id*) of the SCC.
	- If we didn't start the min process, we can pop off the element from the stack
- After *visiting all the neighbors*, 
	- **if the current node started a connected component**, meaning the *lowlink = index* 
	 - Then *pop nodes off the stack until current node is reached.* 
	 - This means removing all the associated nodes of the SCC.
## Example
- If a node's color is grey or orange then it is on the stack and we can update its low-link value.
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724114900.png)
- Start anywhere , as we visit them along give them a node id (index) and low-link equal to its id.
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724115226.png)
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724115718.png)

- As we reached node 2, our only option is now to visit node 0.
	- We know that node 0 is already visited, and that means we found a back-edge
		![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724115744.png)
	- Let's check whether back-edge's destination node 0 is already in the stack. ( this is why we want a set!)
	- it seems node 0 is in the stack. We start the min process!
		- lowlink\[2\] = min(lowlink\[2\] , lowlink\[0\])
		![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724120157.png)
- As DFS, we return from recursive call for node 2, but pay attention we don't pop node 2 from the stack,
	- Because we started a min process! Min process prevents popping off the elements until the SCC is completely discovered.
	- This is for propagating the low-link value through out the cycle.
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724121031.png)

- Continuing with the min process, and propagating the low-link value
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724121821.png)
- Continuing with the min process, and propagating the low-link value
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724122020.png)
- Continuing with the min process, and propagating the low-link value. and it seems that we have visited all the neighbors of node zero and reached a node where the id and lowlink are the same
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724122332.png)
- When we completed a SCC (the case **v.lowlink = v.index**), meaning we are at the root of the SCC, now we can pop off all associated nodes of SCC off the stack.
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724122614.png)
- However we are not exploring the graph so pick another starting node at random. We pick another node at random
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724122835.png)
- Start DFS again like we did above, once we reach node 0, we realize that it is already visited, meaning we found a back-edge, but node 0 is not on the stack, *so we don't start the min process*
	- This is very very good, because if we did, we would contaminate strongly connected component node 5 as part of with a lower low-link value which node 0 was to offer.
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724122947.png)

- Let's go node 6
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724141220.png)
- Let's go to node 2, node 2 is already visited (we found a back-edge) and it is not on the stack , so we don't do start the min process. 
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724150200.png)

- Let's go to node 4, but it is already visited (so we hit a back-edge) and node 4 is already on the stack. So we start the min process -> this means we started a SCC
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724150304.png)

- Since , we started the min process, that means we have to propagate the low-link value.
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724150550.png)
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724150623.png)
- Now we have completed our SCC, because id == low-link value (node 4 is start/root of a scc). We can pop off all the associated nodes of this SCC off the stack.
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724150848.png)

- Now coming back to node 3, we can't min its low-link value with node 4, because node 4 is not on the stack any more. 
	- One more thing to notice is that low-link value and the id of the node 3 is equal to each other, meaning node 3 is the root of a SCC. However we didn't finish visiting all the neighbors of this node, so we can't make this assessment yet.
	 ![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724151604.png)

- Let's visit node 7, and continue our DFS
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724151648.png)

- Let's visit node 5, but node 5 is already visited, so we found a back-edge however node 5 is not on the stack, so we don't start the min process
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724152003.png)

- We go back to node 3, node 3 is already visited, so we found a back-edge and node 3 is already on the stack, we start the min process
	- lowlink\[7\] = min(lowlink\[7\], lowlink\[3\]) = 3
	 ![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724152230.png)

 - we keep doing min in order to propagate the low-link value.
	 - lowlink\[3\] = min(lowlink\[3\], lowlink\[7\])
	  ![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724152440.png)
	
- We back track to node 3, and see that its low-link and id is the same, so this is the root of a SCC. 
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230724152710.png)
	- and we can pop off all the associated nodes now and stack becomes empty and we are done.

## Pseudo-code

```Julia
n = number of nodes in the graph
g = adjacency list with directed edges
id = 0
low-link = [0,0,0,....,0] # length n
sccCount = 0
stack= an empty stackSet 

function findSCCs(graph):
	for vertex in graph.vertices():
		vertex.label = UNVISITED
	end
	for vertex in graph.vertices():
		if vertex.label == UNVISITED:
			dfs(graph,vertex)
		end
	end
	return low
end

function dfs(graph,vertex)
	#push on to the stack
	stack.push(vertex)
	vertex.stacked = true
	#set the vertex id and lowlink value to same 
	vertex.id = id++
	low-link[vertex.id] = vertex.id

	# visit all neighbors & min low-link in callback
	for to : graph[vertex]:
		#DFS part
		if to.label == UNVISITED:
			dfs(graph,to)
		#to is visited now, or already visited
		#after the recursive call.
		if to in stack:
			low-link[vertex.id] = min(low-link[vertex.id],low-link[to.id])
	end
	#after visitation of all neighbors, we keep popping until all the associated nodes are popped off.
	if low-link[vertex.id] == vertex.id :
		node = stack.pop()
		while(node != vertex)
			low-link[node.id] = vertex.id
		end
		sccCount++
	end
end
```
