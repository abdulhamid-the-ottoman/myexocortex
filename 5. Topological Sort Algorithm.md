# Topological Sort Algorithm
- Many real world problems may need to be modelled with directed edges where some events must occur before others.
	- School class prerequisites
	- Program dependencies
	- Event Scheduling
	- Assembly Instructions
	- Etc.

## Prerequisite Examples
- Here is a class dependency example:
![Pasted image 20230719135759.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719135759.png)
- In order to take the class H, one must take the classes A,B,D,E as prerequisites.
- This implies that there is an ordering on the nodes of the graph.

## Program Build Dependencies
- A program can't be built unless its dependencies are first built.

- Here is the order we came up with to build the program at J.

## What is Topological  Ordering?

- A **topological ordering** is an ordering of the nodes in a directed graph where the nodes can be aligned in a line and have all the edges pointing to the right.
![Pasted image 20230719144251.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719144251.png)
- Topological orderings are not unique, you can have multiple topological ordering of the same directed graph.
- **Topological sort** algorithm can find a topological ordering in **O(V+E) time.**

## What type of Graphs can have topological Ordering?

- Not every graph can have a topological ordering.
	- A graph which contains a *cycle* can't have a valid ordering.
		![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719144614.png)

	 - If there is a cycle, every node in that cycle depends on each other, so there is no where to start.
	 - The only type of graph which has a valid topological ordering is **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) **
	 - Which of the following are DAGs?
	 ![Pasted image 20230719181616.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719181616.png)

 - How do i verify that my graph doesn't contain a directed cycle?
	 - One method is to use Tarjan's strongly connected component algorithm in order to find the cycles.

## Topological Ordering Of Trees
- By definition, all rooted trees have a topological ordering since they don't contain any cycles.
	- An easy way to find the topological ordering of a tree is to iteratively pick the leaf nodes.
		![IMG_F3EF5AD4BCE7-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_F3EF5AD4BCE7-1.jpeg)
       - Once all the leaves are finished , you can continue to pick from the new layer.
	       ![Pasted image 20230719150240.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719150240.png)
	 - Once the root of a subtree has all his children grayed out, it becomes available
		![Pasted image 20230719150514.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719150514.png)
	 - We keep doing this until no more nodes are left.


## Topological Sort in a DAG using DFS
- Steps to repeat
	- Pick an unvisited node.
	- Beginning with the selected node, do a DFS exploring only reachable unvisited nodes.
	- On the recursive callback of the DFS, add  the current node to the topological ordering in the reverse order.
- Here is an example running through all steps:
	- Here is our initial DAG where all vertices are unvisited and all edges are undiscovered.
		 ![IMG_F8666C8629CF-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_F8666C8629CF-1.jpeg)
	- Let's pick an arbitrary vertex, let it be H.
		  ![IMG_8702F2EE9804-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_8702F2EE9804-1.jpeg)
	- Let's start our DFS process and explore from vertex H
		 ![IMG_90BA6CE3A18F-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_90BA6CE3A18F-1.jpeg)
	- Let's go to vertex J
		![IMG_2ED25714A9DC-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_2ED25714A9DC-1.jpeg)
	- Let's go to vertex M
		![IMG_ECD94E2C4CA7-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_ECD94E2C4CA7-1.jpeg)
	- There is nowhere else to visit from M, so pop it from our stack and add it our topological ordering and we back-track to J
		 ![IMG_4F2E39B1C9D4-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_4F2E39B1C9D4-1.jpeg)
	- We go to L
		 ![IMG_001CE2EE06AE-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_001CE2EE06AE-1.jpeg)
	- There is nowhere to go from L, so pop it from the stack and add it to the topological ordering. And we back-track to J.
		 ![IMG_CBDA624522E4-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_CBDA624522E4-1.jpeg)
	- There is  nowhere else to go from J either, so we pop it and add it to the ordering, and back track to H
		![IMG_0B41A58A6888-1 1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_0B41A58A6888-1%201.jpeg)
	- We go to I
		 ![IMG_E53445845551-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_E53445845551-1.jpeg)
	- We then try to go to L 
		![IMG_D8757191CA52-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_D8757191CA52-1.jpeg)
	-  but we realize that L is already visited, then we back track to I
		![IMG_29C4B3FD2E37-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_29C4B3FD2E37-1.jpeg)
	- since there is nowhere to go from I, we pop it and add it to ordering, and back track to H
		![IMG_DB67E056D5D4-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_DB67E056D5D4-1.jpeg)
	- Since there is nowhere to go from node H, we pop it too and add it to ordering and backtrack to empty stack.
		![IMG_0899E30BBFB9-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_0899E30BBFB9-1.jpeg)
	 
	- Then we re-start the whole process by picking another unvisited node until there are none. Let it be node E.
		![IMG_5DEEEC11C038-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_5DEEEC11C038-1.jpeg)
	- Here is the end of the steps performed
		![Pasted image 20230719155447.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719155447.png)
	- Then we pick another unvisited node arbitrarily, let it be C.
		![Pasted image 20230719155617.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719155617.png)
	- Then we finish the steps and end up with:
		![Pasted image 20230719155706.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719155706.png)


## Pseudo-code
```Julia
#assumption : graph is stored as an adjacency list

function topsort(graph)
	N = graph.numberofNodes();
	ordering = [0,...,0] #index for ordering array, length N - nodes id is put within this array
	i = N-1 # we start filling our ordering array from the last.
	#pick arbitrary non visited vertex
	for (vertex in graph.vertices) 
		if (not vertex.isVisited)
			#perform DFS
			i = dfs(i,vertex, ordering, graph)
	end

	#return ordering
	ordering
end

function dfs(ind,vertex,ordering,graph)
	vertex.visited = true
	#perform DFS
	for(edge in incidentEdges(graph,vertex))
		w = adj_vertex(vertex,edge)
		if (not w.isVisited)
			ind = dfs(i,w,ordering,graph)
	end
	#On the recursive callback of the DFS, add  the current node to the topological ordering in the reverse order.
	ordering[ind] = vertex.id
	return i-1  
end
```


## Topological Sort using Degrees of Vertices
- The intuition behind this algorithm is to repeatedly removing nodes without any dependencies (in-degree = 0) from the graph and add them to the topological ordering.
- As nodes without dependencies (and their out going edges ) are removed from the graph, new nodes without dependencies should become free.
- We repeat removing nodes without dependencies from the graph until all nodes are processed, or a cycle is discovered.
	- So we can use this algorithm as cycle detector as well.

#### Let's detect a cycle
- Try and imagine what happens if you try to find the topological ordering of a graph that contains a cycle.
	![Pasted image 20230719182138.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719182138.png)
- First we pick node 4, the only node without any dependencies (in-degree = 0)
	![Pasted image 20230719182228.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719182228.png)
- Then you would process node 1, which no longer depends on 4.
	![Pasted image 20230719182305.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719182305.png)

 - Followed by node 0, which no longer depends on node 1.
	 ![Pasted image 20230719182344.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719182344.png)
 - Then you get stuck, because now there is no vertex with in-degree = 0
	 ![Pasted image 20230719182435.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719182435.png)

#### Let's run the algorithm on an example graph
- Initially our graph looks like this:
	![Pasted image 20230719184340.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719184340.png)

- Node 2 is the only node without dependencies.
	![Pasted image 20230719184429.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719184429.png)

- Add node 2 to the topological ordering, and remove it from the graph.
	![Pasted image 20230719184656.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719184656.png)

- Node 0 and node 4 don't have any dependencies. Select either to be added to the topological ordering.
	![Pasted image 20230719184747.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719184747.png)

- Select and remove Node 0
	![Pasted image 20230719184833.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719184833.png)

- Select and remove Node 4
	![Pasted image 20230719184910.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719184910.png)

- Node 3 and Node 5 don't have any dependencies. Select either to be added to the ordering. We pick node 3
	![Pasted image 20230719185024.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719185024.png)

- Node remove Node 5.
	![Pasted image 20230719185054.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719185054.png)

- Finally remove node 1 and finish
	![Pasted image 20230719185131.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230719185131.png)


## Pseudo-code

```Julia
#graph is represented as an adjacency list
function findTopoOrder(graph)
	n = graph.numberofNodes()
	#holds the in-degree for every node
	in_order = [0,...,0] # length n
	#loop through every edge and count the in-degree
	for(edge in graph.edges())
		in_order[edge.dest().id]++;
	end

	#q is a queue which keeps the node id with no incoming edge.
	for(i in 0:n)
		if(in_degree[i] == 0 )
			q.enqueue(i)
	end

	#next location in the ordering array
	index = 0
	#the array holding the topo-order
	order = [0,...,0] #length 0
	while(!q.isEmpty())
		#remove the first one
		at = q.dequeue()
		#push it into the order
		order[index++] = at
		for( edge in graph.getNode(at).getOutEdges())
			#decrementing the dependencies after removal
			dest_vertex_id = edge.dest().id
			in_degree[dest_vertex_id]--;
			if(in_degree[dest_vertex_id] == 0)
				q.enqueue(dest_vertex_id)
		end
		#if the index is not equal to the number of vertices, we got stuck
		if(index != n):
			return NOT_FOUND
		else
			return order
	end
	
end
```
