# Overview of Algorithms in Graph Theory
- A lot of problems you can encounter can be reduced to common problems in the graph theory.

## Identification Of Graph Problem
- Is the graph directed or undirected?
- Is the graph weighted?
- Is the graph sparse or dense with edges?
- Should i use an adjacency matrix, adjacency list, an edge list or other structure to represent the graph efficiently?

## Shortest Path Problem

^d5d0a9

- Given a weighted graph, find the shortest path of edges from a start node to an end node.

-  There are several algorithms to do this : 
	- BFS (un-weighted graph), 
	- Dijsktra's Algorithm
	- Bellman-Ford
	- Floyd-Warshall
	- A*
	- many more

## Connectivity

^9bd1f4

- Does there exist a path between node A and node B?

- Typical solutions include:
	- Using union-find data structure
	- Any search algorithm ( e.g DFS, BFS)

## Negative Cycles

^3b4cbc

- Does my weighted digraph have any negative cycles? If so, where? Detecting them.

	- You can see in the graph above, nodes 1 3 and 2 form a negative cycle with the cost of ( 4 + (-6) + 1) = -1.
	- In the context of finding shortest path, it is a like a trap, you can keep smaller and smaller costs by traversing the cycle.
	- There are also contexts where negative cycles are beneficial,
		- suppose we are trading currencies across an exchange or multiple exchanges currency prices try to remain consistent throughout the day across exchanges but sometimes there are inconsistencies leading to smth called "arbitrage", where you cycle through a bunch of currencies ending up at that the start currency with more money. (relates to finding negative cycles)
- Typical Solutions Include:
	- Bellman-Ford
	- Floyd-Warshall


## Strongly Connected Components

^2e1aa3

- Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) can be thought of as self-contained cycles within a directed graph where every vertex in a given cycle can reach every other vertex in the same cycle.

- This is very useful in many algorithms and usually an intermediate step.
- There are common algorithms doing this:
	- Tarjan's algorithm
	- Kosajaru's algorithm

## Traveling Salesman Problem

^38e6e5

- Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?‚Äù

- The TSP problem is NP-Hard meaning it‚Äôs a very computationally challenging problem. 
	- This is unfortunate because the TSP has several very important applications.
- There are several algorithms to solve this:
	- Held-Karp Algorithm with dynamic programming
	- One of the branch and bound algorithms
	- One of the approximation algorithms such as ant colony optimization.

## Bridges

^e34432

- A bridge / cut edge is *any edge* in a graph whose removal increases the number of connected components.
![Pasted image 20230717145823.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717145823.png)

- Bridges are important in a graph, because they often hint at weak points, bottlenecks or vulnerabilities in a graph.
	- You can think of the nodes as islands and the edges as bridges. you can see the importance of detecting bridges.
 
## Articulation Points

^718abc

- An articulation point / cut vertex is *any node* in a graph whose removal increases the number of connected components.

![Pasted image 20230717150330.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717150330.png)
- Articulation points are important in a graph, because they often hint at weak points, bottlenecks, or vulnerabilities in a graph.


## Minimum Spanning Tree

^2caf88

- A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717150521.png)![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717150552.png)

- MSTs are seen in many applications including: Designing a least cost network, circuit
  design, transportation networks, and etc...
- There can be multiple MSTs in a graph, so it is not unique.
- The well known algorithms are:
	- Kruskal's
	- Prim's
	- Boruvka's

## Network Flow : Max Flow

^582002

- Q: With an infinite input source how much ‚Äúflow‚Äù can we push through the network?
- This question is important because there is bound to be a bottleneck in our flow graph that limits the amount of stuff we can have traveling on the network.
	- We can identify the bottleneck edges and fix them.
- The maximum flow would then represent things like
	- volume of water allowed to flow through the network of pipes.
	- maximum number of cars that the network of roads can sustain.

- This is the most fascinating problem, and it is about finding the maximum flow through a special type of graph called a flow network.
	- Flow networks are graphs where edge weights represent capacities in some sense.
	- Suppose the edges are roads with cars, pipes with water or hallways with packed with people.Flow represents the volume of water allowed to flow through the pipes, the number of cars the roads can sustain in traffic and the maximum amount of people that can navigate through the hallways.
- Known algorithms:
	- Ford-Fulkerson
	- Edmond's Karp
	- Dinic's Algorithm
