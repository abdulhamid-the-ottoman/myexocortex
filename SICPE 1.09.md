# 🌍 Problem Definition

> [!QUESTION] Problem
> Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures `inc`, which increments its argument by 1, and `dec`, which decrements its argument by 1.
> 
> ```scheme
> (define (+ a b)
>   (if (= a 0)
>       b
>       (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
> 
> (define (+ a b)
>   (if (= a 0)
>       b
>       (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
> ```
> 
> Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating `(+ 4 5)`. Are these processes iterative or recursive?

## 🔑 **Key Points of Understanding**
- if the shape of the process is expanding and constructing then it is recursive process
- if the shape is flat, then it is iterative.
# 🔍 Solutions
```Scheme
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5 ))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```
- obviously this is a recursive process

```Scheme
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9
```
- obviously this is an iterative process. Tail-call optimization
