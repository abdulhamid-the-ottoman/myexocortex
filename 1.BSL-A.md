# Beginning Student Language - Part A

## Learning Goals
- Be able to write expressions that operate on primitive data including numbers, strings, images and booleans.
- Be able to write constant and function definitions.
- Be able to write out the step-by-step evaluation of simple expressions including function calls.
- Be able to use the stepper to automatically step through the evaluation of an expression.
- Be able to use the Dr Racket help desk to discover new primitives.

## Expressions
- Here is generic view of DR Racket composed of "Definitions area" and "Interaction area"
	![Pasted image 20230803131924.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803131924.png)

- Here is example expressions you can type in the definitions area
```Scheme
(+ 3 4)
(+ 3 (* 2 3))
(/ 12 (* 2 3))
```

- We give Racket expressions, and it evaluates the expressions to produce values.
- So to form an expression in racket, we basically 
	- open  paren
	- put the name of primitive operator like (+, / , \*)
	- then any number of other expressions
	- close paren
```
(<primitive op> <expression>...)
```

- Expressions can be actual values
	- So numbers themselves can be expressions
- you can use  semicolons to comment out the code
- In Dr Racket, under the insert menu, you can insert a comment box in which everything is a comment.

- Here is an exercise
	![Pasted image 20230803133105.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803133105.png)
  - How do you write that expression:
	  - First you need the square of 3. `(sqr 3)`
	  - Second you need the square of 4 `(sqr 4)`
	  - Then you need to add them up `(+ (sqr 3) (sqr 4))`
	  - Then you need to square root the result `(sqrt (+ (sqr 3) (sqr 4)))`

- You can be a very good program designer without knowing a lot of math.
- There are certain kinds of programs in graphics, computer vision or machine learning where you need to know a lot of math.

- When you do `(sqrt 2)` , racket tells you: `#i1.4142135623730951`
	- why is it prefixing the result with `#i`?
	- You know the that the square root of 2 is an irrational number
	- What it means to be an irrational number is that it takes infinite space to write that number down.
		- Computers are not infinite in size
		- They are quite finite in size
		- So you can't represent the infinity precisely, `#i` means it is an inexact number, meaning the result shown is pretty close to this number but not exactly the same.

## Evaluation
- Rules that DrRacket uses to evaluate the kinds of BSL expressions we have seen so far. 
- Understanding these rules is key to 
	- understanding how your programs really work,
	- figure out what is wrong if your program does not work as expected.
- In order to be able to understand big programs,
	- we really need to understand the detailed rules by which the expressions get evaluated.
	- We don't always need to think in terms of those rules, but we do need to have them to fall back on.

### Primitive Call Rule As **Evaluation Rule 1**
- Here is the expression shown we want to see evaluated in step by step fashion:
	![Pasted image 20230803134703.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803134703.png)
	- in an expression which is a call to a primitive
	- the first one is called operator
	- the rest is called operands
- To evaluate a primitive call
	- First reduce operands to values
	- Then apply primitive to the values.
- Here is how the evaluation of that expression stepped through according the rules above:
	![Pasted image 20230803135058.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803135058.png)

- So the intuition to take away from this example is:
	- the evaluation of an expression in general proceeds from left to right
	- the evaluation of an expression in general proceeds inside to outside
		- because all the operands must be reduced to values so that the outer operator can proceed.

## String and Images
- In this section you will learn about two new kinds of primitive values: 
	- strings letting us represent words and names
	- images letting us build up pictures
- We will also cover some commonly used primitives that operate on strings and images.
	- calls to images and strings work like just calls to number primitives
- To form a string
	![Pasted image 20230803135906.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803135906.png)
- Strings evaluate to themselves
	![Pasted image 20230803140006.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803140006.png)

- Operations we can do on Strings:
	- Appending them together by `(string-append "Ada" " " "Lovelace")` resulting in *"Ada Lovelace"*
	- Find their length by `(string-length "apple")` resulting in 5
	- You can extract substrings from them. Here is an example `(substring "Caribou" 2 4)` where we pick the \[2,4).  This results in "ri".
		- The first character starts at zero index
		- 2nd char is 'r', and 3rd char is 'i' . 4 th char is excluded
	- So if you want to get the first 3 chars of a string:
		- `(substring "Caribou" 0 3)`

- You can create new tabs in Dr Racket by File -> new tab.
- Now for the images:
	- In order to manipulate images in DR Racket.
	- First we need our image library imported -> `(require 2htdp/image)` must at the top of our definition area.
- Here is some calls using images:
	![Pasted image 20230803142558.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803142558.png)

- Here is another call (above), which all images that it receives as arguments, and stacks one on top of the other 
	![Pasted image 20230803142857.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803142857.png)
- or another call (beside) to stack them side by side
	![Pasted image 20230803142955.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803142955.png)

- or another call (overlay) to stack them inside the other.
	![Pasted image 20230803143256.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803143256.png)

## Constant Definitions
- We will learn how to write constant definitions
	- to give names to values to so that we can use those values in different parts of the program
- Constants make programs that are easy for other people 
	- to read  --> increasing the *readability* of the program
	- to change --> increasing the *changeability* of the program
- Readability and Changeability are 2 most important quality a program can have.
- You can define constants using the keyword `define` :
	![Pasted image 20230803143934.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803143934.png)
	- Here are 2 constants, (constants are usually written in CAPITAL letters)
	- When you run it, it doesn't produce any output (due to `define` keyword)

- When you use these constants in an expression, you can see them being evaluated to their values first
	![Pasted image 20230803145202.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803145202.png)
	 - Here are the evaluation steps involved:
	 ![Pasted image 20230803145259.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803145259.png)
- To form a constant definition:
	![Pasted image 20230803145351.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803145351.png)

    - You can see the constant name is *very generous with characters except quotes or parenthesis of any kind.*
	    - no quotes of any kind
	    - no parenthesis of any kind
- Here are the evaluation rules for constant definitions:
	![Pasted image 20230803145619.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803145619.png)

	- Remember this:
	 ![200](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803145747.png)

- Here is another example with cats:
		![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803150009.png)

- We can define more constants based on previous constants
	- once an expression is evaluated, for evermore the resulting value will be associated with the constant name.
	- So that we can use it in other places in the program.
		![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803150230.png)

## Function Definitions
- Functions are the mechanism in the BSL that's going to let you write programs that produce a different value each time they run.
- Let's look at the code below and identify the duplicated code:
		![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803150632.png)
	- We can prevent this cumbersome and needless typing using *function definitions*, but first let's learn about how to define a function.
- Here is how functions work:
	![Pasted image 20230803151043.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803151043.png)

- Here is how we define them in Dr Racket:
	![Pasted image 20230803151230.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803151230.png)

- Now we can eliminate the duplicated in the call "above" by doing the following:
	- using a function makes the code in the comment box more concise
	- if the function is named well, it gives the code more meaning as well.
	![300](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230803151622.png)

- Here is how you form a function expression
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230807121443.png)
- Here is how you form an function call expression
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230807121554.png)

- Here is how you evaluate a function call.
	![Pasted image 20230807121840.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230807121840.png)


## Boolean Expressions
- Expressions producing true-false values are often called predicates
- Boolean expressions let you present true and false values
		![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230807122648.png)
- Here is another one, using image width comparison.
		![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230807123000.png)
## If expressions
- Here is how to form an if expression:
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230807123140.png)
- Here is an example, where we test whether the rectangle is wide or tall.
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230807123416.png)
- Here are the rules for evaluating `if` expressions:
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230807123959.png)
- Here is rules are applied by hand:
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230807124720.png)

- Here is two expressions - `and  or` with special evaluation rules (short circuiting) and one normal function. `not`
		![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230807130410.png)

- Here is how you form an `and` or `or` expression
 ![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230807131232.png)
- As for the evaluation rules of and
	- and keeps evaluating argument expressions \<expr1\> until it hits false and returns false, otherwise returns true.
	- In the previous example at line 8, it hits a false expression and returns false immediately.
- As for the evaluation rules of or.
	- and keeps evaluating until it hits true, and returns true otherwise returns false
	- In the previous example, at line 13 , it hits true and returns true.


## Stepper
- Here is the program where we are gonna use the stepper on.
	![Pasted image 20230807134729.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230807134729.png)

- Here we go:

## Discovering more primitives
- In the BSL, there are far too many primitives to cover. So you have to be able to discover them on your own.
- There are 2 general techniques for discovering primitives.
	- The first one is to have a lucky guess. It turns out that what happens after you have been programming for a while, you start to get a pretty good sense of what the naming conventions are.
	- Look up the documentation and scroll down for the related function you want.
- Luck Guess:
	- For example you can try a triangle, and it works
		`(triangle 50 "solid" "purple)"`
	- You can ctrl click on `triangle` and search in help desk for Triangle
