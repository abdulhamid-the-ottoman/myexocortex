# Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
- Minimum spanning tree is a sub-graph
	- which includes all the vertices of the original graph.
	- it is connected!
	- no cycles
- Essentially we are constructing a tree from the graph.
- Why do we call it minimum?
	- Because we want the summation of those edges' weight to be minimum
- Here is an example:

- A graph can have multiple valid MSTs of equal costs.
- Here is a disconnected graph, and disconnected graphs have no MST.

## Prim's Algorithm
- Prim's is a greedy MST algorithm that works well on *dense graphs*.
	- On these graphs, Prim's meets or improves on the time bounds of it popular rivals (Kruskal's & Boruvka's)
- However, when it comes to finding the *minimum spanning forest* on a disconnected graph,
	- Prim's can't do this as easily 
	- the algorithm must be run on each connected component individually
- The *lazy version* of Prim's has a runtime of **O(E\*log(E))**
- The *eager version* of Prim's has a better runtime of **O(E\*log(V))**

### Steps
- Maintain a min priority queue (PQ) that sorts edges based on min edge cost.
	- This will be used to determine the next node to visit and the edge to be used to get there.
- Choose an arbitrary start vertex (let's called it a).
	- Mark a as visited
	- Iterate over all edges of a, adding them to the PQ.
- While the PQ is not empty and MST has not been formed
	- dequeue the next cheapest edge from the PQ.
	- If the dequeued edge is outdated ( meaning the node reached with it is already visited), then skip it, because you are creating a cycle
	- Otherwise mark the current node as visited and add the selected edge to the MST.
- Iterate over the new current node's edges and add all its edges to the PQ
	- don't add edges to the PQ which point to already visited nodes.

## Example
- Here is our undirected graph
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726124544.png)
- Let's select A as our start node and add the outgoing edges (shown in green) to the PQ
	![Pasted image 20230726125740.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726125740.png)
- Poll the one with min edge (shown in purple)
  ![Pasted image 20230726130731.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726130731.png)
- We reached B,  we add the green out-going edges to the PQ and poll the min one
	![Pasted image 20230726130847.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726130847.png)
-  We reached D, and add new green edge between D & E
	- Also, i marked the edge between A and D as turqoise. Because both ends are visited. Meaning this is one of the edges to be skipped.
 - Let's pick the min edge again from PQ and we reached at node E
	 - we add the new green edge (E&C) to our PQ
	 - also if we pick the min edge , it would give us the edge between E&B, however B is visited. So we skip this edge, hence it is turqoise colored. (we don't like cycles)
- Hence we pick the next min edge 4 (B&G) and add new outgoing green edges to PQ from G

- Select the min edge again
	![Pasted image 20230726132735.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726132735.png)

- Finally the MST revels itself when we include all the nodes
	![Pasted image 20230726132858.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726132858.png)

## Pseudo Code
```Julia
#n - number of nodes in the graph
#pq is our priority queue
function lazyPrims(s)
	m = n -1
	edgeCnt, mstCost = 0,0
	mstEdges = [null, ... , null] # length m
	addEdges(s)
	while !pq.isEmpty and edgeCnt !=m 
		edge = pq.dequeue()
		to = edge.to
		if visited[to.id]
			continue
		end
		mstEdges[edgeCnt++] = edge
		mstCost += edge.cost

		addEdges(to)
	end
	if edgeCnt != m
		return (null,null)
	end
	return (mstCost, mstEdges)
end

function addEdges(node)
	visited[node.id] = true
	edges = g[node.id]
	for(edge : edges)
		if !visited[edge.to.id]
			pq.enqueue(edge)
		end
	end
end
```

## The Eager Prim's Algorithm
- The lazy implementation of Prim's inserts up to E edges into the PQ. Therefore, each poll operation on the PQ is  *O(log(E))*
- Instead of blindly inserting edges into a PQ which could later become stale,
	- the eager version of Prim's tracks **(node,edge)** key-value pairs that can easily be *updated* and *polled* to determine the next best edge to add to the MST.
- **Key realization:**
	- For any MST with directed edges, each node is paired with *exactly one* of its incoming edges (except for the start node)
	- Here is the MST from the last example, but this time it is represented as (node,edge) pair. The only one that doesn't have an incoming edge is the start node.
		![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726142218.png)
- So what we will try to do is to determine which of a node's incoming edges we should select to include in the MST.
	- A slight difference from the lazy version is that instead of adding edges to the PQ as we iterate over the edges of node, we are going to *relax* (update) the destination node's most promising incoming edge.
- **How are we going to efficiently update and retrieve this (node,edge) pairs?**
	- One possible solution is to use an *Indexed Priority Queue (IPQ)* which can efficiently update and poll key-value pairs.
	 - This reduces the overall time complexity from *O(E\*logE)*  to **O(E\*logV*)** since there can only be V (node,edge) pairs in the IPQ, making the update and poll operations *O(logV)*
## Steps
- Maintain a *Min Indexed Priority Queue (IPQ)* of size V that sorts vertex-edge pairs (v,e) based on the min edge cost of e.
	- By default all vertices v have a best value of (v,$\phi$) in the IPQ.
- Start the algorithm on any node 's' .
	- Mark s as visited and *relax* all edges of s.
		![Pasted image 20230726141042.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726141042.png)
- While the IPQ is not empty and MST has not been formed
	- dequeue the next best (v,e) pair from the IPQ
	- mark node v as visited and add the edge to MST
- Next
	- relax all edges of v while making sure not to relax any edge pointing to a node which is already visited.

## Example
- Here is a graph where we will find MST
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726164444.png)
- Let's pick a start vertex (vertex 0) and traverse edges
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726164540.png)
	 - now the edges have 2 values
		 - the first one shows the destination, and our key value for indexing
		 - the second one is the distance
	- Our IPQ is a min PQ for edge cost. As seen from above we added the edges to our IPQ 
- Let's select the min edge and reach to vertex 2.
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726165127.png)
 - Lets traverse the edges and add to IPQ
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726165220.png)
	- One thing you should pay attention to, we relaxed the incoming edge to vertex 5 by using the decreaseKey from IPQ therefore the previous key-value pair (5,7) is now (5,6) 
		- <5,7> edge is now torqoise
- Let's pick the min one again and we reach to node 3 and add edges to IPQ
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726171259.png)
	- Pay attention to node 1, we relaxed its incoming edge cost from 9 to -2
	- Pay attention to node 5, we also relaxed its IPQ value from 6 to 2.
- Let's let it play out.
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726171328.png)
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726171403.png)
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726171431.png)
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726171448.png)
- Finally the MST
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726171519.png)

## Pseudo Code
```Julia
function eagerPrims(start)
	m = n-1
	edgeCount, mstCost = 0,0
	mstEdges = [null, ... , null] # size m
	relaxEdgesAtNode(start)
	while !pq.isEmpty and edgeCnt != m
		dest, edge = ipq.dequeue()
		mstEdges[edgeCnt++] = edge
		mstCost += edge.cost
		relaxEdgesAtNode(dst)
	end

	if edgeCnt != m
		return (null,null)
	end
	return (mstCost, mstEdges)
end

function relaxEdgesAtNode(node)
	visited[node.id] = true
	edges = g[node.id]

	for (edge : edges)
		dest = edge.to
		if visited[dest.id]
			continue
		end
		if !ipq.contains(dest)
			ipq.insert(dest,edge)
		else
			ipq.decreaseKey(dest,edge)
		end
	end
end
```
