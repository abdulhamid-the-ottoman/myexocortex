# Procedures and the Processes They Generate

> [!INFO] The Gist
> - To become experts, we must learn to visualize the processes by various types of procedures. 
> - Only after we have developed such a skill can we learn to reliably construct programs that exhibit the desired behavior

- A procedure is a pattern for the local evolution of a computation process: how one stage is built on the previous stage.
- The global behavior of a computational process is much harder to reason about.
- Processes governed by different types of procedures generate different "shapes".
- Computational processes consume 2 important resources : time and space.
