# Eulerian Path - Circuit Algorithm

- If you have an algorithm for finding an eulerian path, finding an eulerian circuit comes for free.
	- All you need to do is to feed the graph with the Euler circuit into the eulerian path algorithm, and out comes the eulerian circuit.
	- It is not very different between finding eulerian path in either directed or undirected edges.

## Algorithm Steps
### First Step
- We have to determine if there even exists an Eulerian path.
- Here is a directed graph:
	![Pasted image 20230726052824.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726052824.png)
	- Once we verified that no node has 
		- too many outgoing edges 
			- N(out\[i\] - in\[i]) = 1 
		- too many incoming edges
			- N(in\[i\] - out\[i\]) = 1
	- It seems we just have the right amount to have an eulerian path.

### Second Step
- Now we have to choose a valid starting point, because we can't start the algorithm at any node we choose at random.
	- pay attention that node 1 is the only node with extra outgoing edge. So it is our only valid start point.
	- Similarly node 6 is the only node with extra incoming node. So it is our only valid end point.
- In the case of an eulerian circuit,
	- Every node must have their in-degree = out-degree
	- This way we are allowed to pick any node as our start node

### Third Step
- Now, we have everything we need to find our eulerian path.
- Let's see what happens if we do a naive DFS, and try to traverse as many edges as possible until we get stuck.
	![IMG_4B5B0E22FFF8-1.jpeg](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/IMG_4B5B0E22FFF8-1.jpeg)
	- We started at node 1 and executed the DFS by randomly choosing our edges
	- We ended up at node 6.
	- However we weren't able to traverse all the edges in our graph, hence we failed to find an eulerian graph!
	
- What is going on? How can we fix this?
	- We are doing our DFS wrong in order to visit all the edges
	- but we can modify our DFS in order to visit all the edges.
	- let's look at an example to illustrate this.
		![Pasted image 20230726054757.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726054757.png)
		- suppose we start our DFS at node 0.
		- Let's continue:
			![Pasted image 20230726054853.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726054853.png)
			![Pasted image 20230726054920.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726054920.png)
			- Pay attention here, DFS takes one right again, and causes us skip the edges going to node 2 and back again. 
				- However we know that this path is the part of our eulerian path.

			![Pasted image 20230726055016.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726055016.png)
		- Once we get stuck (meaning the current node  has no unvisited outgoing edge), we back-track and add the current node to the solution.
			![Pasted image 20230726055114.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726055114.png)
			- Solution : \[4\]
			![Pasted image 20230726055224.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726055224.png)
			- Solution : \[3,4\]
			- node 1 has remaining unvisited edges, we call DFS in order to extend our eulerian path.

			![Pasted image 20230726055920.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726055920.png)
			- Once again, we are stuck, no more unvisited edges of node 1.
			- We add it into the solution : \[1 3 4\]
		-  Effectively we do this until we return the start node and the recursion unwinds.
			![Pasted image 20230726060212.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726060212.png)
			- Solution \[0,1,2,1,3,4\]
		- The trick is to keep taking unvisited edges on the recursive call back until no unvisited remain.
- Now let's get back to our problem.
	- We already computed the number of outgoing edges in the out array.
	- Now let's begin at the starting node again.
		 ![Pasted image 20230726094122.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726094122.png)
	
      - This time, one thing we are going to do slightly different is every time an edge is taken we will reduce the outgoing edge count for that node.
		![Pasted image 20230726094529.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726094529.png)
		![Pasted image 20230726094554.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726094554.png)
		![Pasted image 20230726094818.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726094818.png)
		![Pasted image 20230726094840.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726094840.png)
		![Pasted image 20230726094956.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726094956.png)
		![Pasted image 20230726095103.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726095103.png)
		![Pasted image 20230726095133.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726095133.png)
	 - When the DFS is stuck, meaning there are no more outgoing edges (out\[i\] = 0),
		 - then we know to backtrack and add the current node to the solution.
		 - When back-tracking, if the current node has any remaining unvisited edges (white edges)
			 - we follow any of them, calling our DFS method recursively to extend the Eulerian path.
			 - We can verify there still are outgoing edges by checking if out\[i\] != 0.
	
	- Now we are at node 4, node 4 has unvisited edges.
		![Pasted image 20230726100127.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726100127.png)
			- Solution = \[6\]
	- We are at node 3, and node 3 has unvisited edges.
		![Pasted image 20230726100439.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726100439.png)
		- Solution = \[6\]
	- We are at node 1, node 1 has unvisited edges
		![Pasted image 20230726101252.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726101252.png)
		- Solution = \[6\]
	- We are at node 2, node 2 has unvisited edges.
		![Pasted image 20230726101409.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726101409.png)
		- Solution = \[6\]
	- We are at node 4, and we are stuck, we back track and add the current node to the solution.
		![Pasted image 20230726101544.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726101544.png)
		- Solution = \[4,6\]
	- Now we are at node 2, node 2 still has an unvisited edge (since out\[i\] = 0), so we need to follow that edge
		![Pasted image 20230726102713.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726102713.png)
		- Solution = \[4,6\]
	- We we visit the unvisited edge.
		![Pasted image 20230726102831.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726102831.png)
	 - Once more, the DFS is stuck, meaning there are no more outgoing edges (out\[i\] = 0)
		 - we know to backtrack and add the current node to the solution
		![Pasted image 20230726103125.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726103125.png)
		- Solution = \[2,4,6\]
	- We are at still node 2, we are once more stuck and we back track and go to node 1.
		![Pasted image 20230726103611.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726103611.png)
		- Solution = \[2,2,4,6\]
		- Pay attention there are two node 2s.
	- We are stuck again, we back track and add it to the solution.
		![Pasted image 20230726103737.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230726103737.png)

		- Solution = \[3,1,2,2,4,6\]
	- We are at node 4, and stuck again and we have to back track

	- We are not 2, and stuck again and we have to back track

## Complexity
- The time complexity to find an eulerian path with this algorithm is *O(E)*
	- Two calculations we are doing:
		- computing in/out degrees
		- DFS are both linear in the number of edges.

## Pseudo-Code
```Julia
n = number of vertices in the graph
m = number of edges in the graph
g = adjacency list representing directed graph

ind  = [0,0, .. , 0 , 0] # length n
outd = [0,0, .. , 0 , 0] # length n 

path = empty integer linked list data structure

function findEulerianPath()
	countDegrees()
	#check whether the graph can have an eulerian path
	if not graphHashEulerianPath()
		return null
	end
	#dfs from the start node
	dfs(findStartNode())

	#the graph might be disconnected, in which case it would be impossible to have an euler path.
	if path.size() == m+1
		return path
	end
	return null
end


function countDegrees()
	for edges in g
		for edge in edges
			outd[edge.from]++
			ind[edge.to]++
		end
	end
end

function graphHasEulerianPath()
	start_nodes, end_nodes = 0,0
	for i in 0:n-1
		if (outd[i] - ind[i] > 1) or (ind[i] - outd[i] > 1)
			return false
		else if outd[i] - ind[i] == 1
			start_nodes++
		else if ind[i] - outd[i] == 1
			end_nodes++
		end
		return (end_nodes == 0 and start_nodes == 0) or (end_nodes == 1 and start_nodes == 1)
	end
end

function findStartNode()
	start = 0
	for i in 0:n-1
		#unique starting node
		if outd[i] - ind[i] == 1
			return i
		end
		#start at any node with an outgoing edge
		if out[i] > 0
			start = i
		end
	end
	return start
end


function dfs(at)
	#while the current node still has outgoing edges
	while(out[at] !=0)
		#select the next unvisited outgoing edge
		next_edge = g[at].get(--out[at])
		dfs(next_edge.to)
	end
	#add current node to the solution.
	path.addFront(at)
end
```
- The out array is currently serving 2 purposes:
	- One purpose is to track whether or not there are still outgoing edges.
	- The other is to index into the adjacency list to select the next outgoing edge.
- This assumes the adjacency list stores edges in a data structure that is indexable in *O(1)*
