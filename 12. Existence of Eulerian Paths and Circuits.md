# Existence of Eulerian Paths and Circuits
## What is an  Eulerian Path?
- An **Eulerian Path** is a path of edges that visits *all the edges in a graph exactly once.*
	- You can visit the same vertex multiple times.!
- First off, not every graph has an eulerian path,.
- We can find an Eulerian path on the following graph, but only if we start at specific nodes.
	- Here is an example where we start from S and we find a path

	 - Here is an other example where we start from the top node and get stuck.

## What is an Eularian Circuit?
- An Eulerian circuit (or Eulerian cycle) is an eulerian path which starts and ends on the same vertex.
- Not every graph has an Eulerian circuit like an eulerian path.
- If you know the graph contains an Eulerian cycle you can begin the circuit at any node.
- Here is an example where we start the Eulerian circuit at the orange node (also ends in)

- If your graph doesn't contain an Eulerian cycle then you may not be able to return to the start node or you may not be able to visit all edges of graph.
	- Here is an example where we slightly modified the previous graph.

       - here is what happens when we try to visit all edges.

## How to determine the existence of an Eulerian Path or Circuit?
- That depends on what kind of graph you are dealing with.
- Altogether there are 4 flavors of the Euler path/circuit problem we care about:
- Here is the table to remember to check the existence

- Here is a reminder about the degrees of a node:

-  For an eulerian circuit in an undirected graph, to exist the requirement is

- For an eulerian path in an undirected graph to exist, the requirement is
	![300](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230725214620.png)
		- In this case, if those 2 vertices with odd degrees exist, they are the start and the end node of our eulerian paths.

- For an eulerian circuit in a directed graph to exist, the requirement is
	![300](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230725214814.png)
- For an eulerian path in a directed graph to exist, the requirement is

## Examples in undirected graphs
- Here is an example graph which violates the circuit/path conditions for an undirected graph
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230725215518.png)
- Here is a graph which only has eulerian path, because it includes 2 vertices with odd degrees.
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230725215832.png)
- Here is an undirected graph in which there is both eulerian path and eulerian circuit.
	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230725222333.png)
- Here is an interesting one.  Does the following undirected graph have an Eulerian path/circuit?
	![Pasted image 20230725223401.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230725223401.png)
	- There are no Eulerian paths/circuits.
	- An additional requirement when finding paths/circuits is that *all vertices with non-zero degree need to belong to a single connected component.*
## Examples in directed graphs

- Here is a directed graph with both an eulerian path and an eulerian circuit. because all in/out degrees are equal.
	![300](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230725223829.png)

- Here is an undirected graph without either an eulerian path or eulerian circuit.
	![Pasted image 20230725224030.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230725224030.png)
	 - No path or circuit. The red nodes have either too many incoming or outgoing edges.

- Here is a directed graph with an eulerian path, but not eulerian circuit.
	- It also has a unique start/end node for the path.
	 ![Pasted image 20230725224803.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230725224803.png)
	  - in-degree(s) = 2 , out-degree(s) =3
		  - out-degree - in-degree = 1
	  - in-degree(e) = 4 , out-degree(e) = 3
		  - in-degree - out-degree = 1
	  - So, it holds the condition for eulerian path.
	  - Note that the singleton node encircled in yellow has no incoming/outgoing edges, 
		  - so it doesn't impact whether or not we have an eulerian path.
