# Skills that Transfer
- The skills acquired from learning to design programs systematically transfer in two directions
	- they apply to programming in general as well as to programming spreadsheets, synthesizers, style sheets, and even word processors.
- [ Function Design Recipe](./Systematic%20Program%20Design.md#^795d68) applies to any programming language, so you can transfer it. It also says a designer must:
	1. Analyze a problem statement, typically stated as a word problem
	2. Extract and express its essence, abstractly;
	3. Illustrate the essence with examples
	4. Make outlines and plans based on this analysis
	5. Evaluate results with respect to expected outcomes
	6. Revise the product in the light of failed checks and tests
