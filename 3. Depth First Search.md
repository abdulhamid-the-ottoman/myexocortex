# Depth First Search
- The **Depth First Search (DFS)** is the most fundamental algorithm to traverse the graph
- Visits all the vertices and edges of that graph
	- Hence it runs with a time complexity of *O(V+E)* , directly proportional to the size of the graph.
	
- By itself the DFS isn‚Äôt all that useful, but when *augmented* to perform other tasks such as 
	- *count connected components* 
	- *determine connectivity,*
	- *find bridges/articulation points*
	
- As the name suggests, a DFS plunges depth first into a graph without regard for which edge it takes next until it cannot go any further at which point it backtracks and continues.

## Steps

^ab699e

- The steps involved:
	- Initially, 
		- all the nodes are unvisited
		- all the edges are undiscovered.
		![Pasted image 20230717174043.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717174043.png)

	- Choose an arbitrary start vertex.
		- Let's choose A as our starting vertex
		- The vertex currently being visited will be current vertex

		![Pasted image 20230717174711.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717174711.png)

	- From the current vertex, pick any undiscovered edge.
		- If the adjacent node that follows is *UNVISITED*, then visit it.
		- Set the traversed edge as *DISCOVERED*
		- Set the reached node as *CURRENT NODE*

		![Pasted image 20230717174920.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717174920.png)

	 - Repeat until all the vertices and edges are finished.
		![Pasted image 20230717175025.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717175025.png)
		- We reached the node C from B , and Set B as current node and traversed edge as discovered
		- Then From C we reached A, but A was already visited. So we marked the edge as a back-edge.
	- We move to the node B.

      - We take the edge from D to A, and since A is visited, we mark the edge as Back-Edge
		![Pasted image 20230717175455.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717175455.png)
	 - Since there are no more undiscovered edges from D, we have to back track.
		 ![Pasted image 20230717175554.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717175554.png)
	 - We continue to node E
		 ![Pasted image 20230717175627.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717175627.png)
       - We take the undiscovered edge between E and A, but A is visited, so we mark it as a back-edge
	       - Then since there will be no more undiscovered edges, we start back tracking until we reach to the start vertex.
	       ![Pasted image 20230717180303.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717180303.png)
       - Here is the rest:

#### Summary

^ae1d6e

- Choose an arbitrary start vertex , visit it  and make it current.
- Search for an undiscovered edge from the current vertex
	- If found
		- It leads to a unvisited vertex?
			- Discover the edge
			- Go to the end vertex and make it current
		- It leads to a visited vertex?
			- mark it as a back-edge
	- Else
		- back-track
- Stop once we back track to the original vertex

#### Code

^690671

```C++
DFS(G){
	for all v in V(G){
		v.label = UNVISITED
	}
	for all e in E(G){
		e.label = UNDISCOVERED
	}
	for all v in V(G){ // for the case of disconnected graph
		if(v.label == UNVISITED){
			visit(v,G)
		}
	}
}

visit(v,G){
	v.label = VISITED;
	for all e in v.incidentEdges{
		if(e.label == UNDISCOVERED){
			w = adj_vertex(v,e);
			if(w.label == UNVISITED){
				e.label = DISCOVERED;
				visit(w,G);
			}
			else{
				e.label = BACK_EDGE;
			}
		}
	}
}
```


## Connected Components

^880288

- This is a simple use case for depth-first search, finding connected components (not strongly) components in a graph.
- Sometimes a graph is split into multiple disjoint components.
	- It is useful to be able to identify and count these components.
	![Pasted image 20230717182528.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717182528.png)
- One way to do so is to color them:
	![Pasted image 20230717182617.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717182617.png)

- What does coloring them mean to a computer?
	- It means labeling each node in a component with the same ID.
	![Pasted image 20230717182749.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717182749.png)

- We can use a DFS to identify components.
	- First make sure all the nodes are labeled from \[0,n) where n is the number of nodes.
	![Pasted image 20230717182921.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717182921.png)

- The basic algorithm is to start a depth-first search at every node except that if that node has been already visited.
	- and mark all reachable nodes part of the same component using the same ID.

- Continue until you covered all the nodes.

#### Code

![Pasted image 20230717183728.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717183728.png)
	- Here how we represent the graph
	- `g` is the adjacency list representation of the graph.
	- `count` tracks the number of connected components
	- `components` is an integer array holding the integer value of which component a node belongs to.
	- `visited` is the boolean array holding whether a node is visited or not.

![Pasted image 20230717185428.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717185428.png)
	- we check for which nodes are visited or not, and if we find an unvisited node, then we found one of the components of the disconnected graph.
	- we increment the count to identify the component and perform DFS starting from the current node.

	- The DFS method updates the `components` with the ID of current component.

## What else can DFS do?

^288939

- We can augment DFS algorithm to do:
	- Compute a graph‚Äôs minimum spanning tree.
	- Detect and find cycles in a graph
	- Check if a graph is bipartite
	- Find strongly connected components
	- Topologically sort the nodes of a graph
	- Find bridges and articulation points
	- Find augmenting paths in a flow network
	- Generate mazes.
