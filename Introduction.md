# Introduction
- Challenges with writing a program:
	- Challenge 1: Poorly formed problem description:
		- Symptoms: task description is *vague*, *incomplete*, *inconsistent*
		- Solution: Figure out that we want our program to do.
	- Challenge 2: Too big of a problem for us to solve in one go.
		- Symptoms:
			- Our brains can only focus on one small part at a time
			- Insurmountable/overwhelming  complexity
		- Solution:
			- Manage that complexity by breaking it down  into *well-chosen smaller pieces* 
		- Results:
			- We can write programs for smaller programs and since they are well-chosen, they can fit together and capable of being well-tested.
			- The resulting program becomes easy to read and easy to modify
- Goal:
	- Having programs that end up being formed of nice pieces that
		- fit together well
		- well tested
		- and easy to modify.
	- In other terms, modular and robust.
- So, *systematic program design* is the whole trip from poorly-formed problem to well-structured solution.

## Study Tips
Here are some tips for doing well in this course. We suggest you read this every week or so for the first few weeks of the course, that will help incorporate these ideas into your work.

1. **Program design is something you learn by doing**
    - Watch the videos actively: try having DrRacket open and typing along with the lecture. Just stop the video if you need a moment to catch up.
    - Use the pause button! If you are watching actively, typing along and so on you will need to pause the video periodically.
    - Try to re-work the lecture problems on your own from scratch after every lecture.
    - Do practice problems, working them from scratch before looking at the solution.¬†  
          
2. **Do not worry about making mistakes!** If you make a mistake and get an error message read the error message, use it to identify the problem and then correct it.  
      
3. **If you are unsure whether something works, try it!** For example,¬†the best way to answer a "does it work to do X" question is by trying it.¬†  
      
4. **Focus on recording the design process, not the end solution* (which is always available by pausing the video).¬†  
      
5. Always be able to identify *what step of the recipe you are on* ‚Äì if you are working on a design problem and you don't know how to proceed step back and ask yourself questions like: What step of the recipe am I at? What should I be doing at that step? Where should I be looking to figure out what to write? Try looking up a similar problem that you have already solved to see what you did at the corresponding step.¬†
