# Abstraction Barriers

> [!INFO]  Data Abstraction
>  - The underlying idea of data abstraction is to identify for each type of data object a basic set of operations in terms of which all manipulations of data objects of that type will be expressed
> 	 - Then to use only those operations in manipulating the data

- Details on the other side of an abstraction barrier are irrelevant to the code on this side.
- This makes programs easier to maintain and modify.

> [!INFO]  Flexibility
>  - Constraining the dependence on the representation to a few interface procedures helps us design programs as well as modify them, because it allows us to maintain the flexibility to consider alternate implementations.
