# Graph Theory
- **Graph theory** is the mathematical theory of the  *properties and applications of graphs*
	- layman call graphs as networks
- **The goal** is to gain an understanding of how to apply graph theory to real world applications.

## Example Problems

^66180e

### Matching Clothing Problem

^2544b8

	![400](Pasted%20image%2020230717115848.png)
- A graph theory problem might be: Given the constraints above, how many different sets of clothing can I make by choosing an article from each category?
- This problem can be solved only using mathematics, but the advantage the graph theory gives us is the visualization of the problem using 
	- nodes to represent an article of clothing
	- edges to represent relationships between them (in this case combination constraint)

### Social Network of Friends

	![400](Pasted%20image%2020230717120327.png)

- This enables interesting questions such as:
	- How many friends does person X have?
	- How many degrees of separation are there between person X and person Y?


## Types of Graphs

^7c0f95

- It is really important to be able to recognize what type of graph you are working with

#### Undirected Graph

^c22ff4

- An undirected graph is a graph in which *edges have no orientation.*
	- The edge (u, v) is identical to the edge (v, u).

- Example of cities and roads:
	- ![Pasted image 20230717120713.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717120713.png)
		- Nodes represent cities
		- Edges represent bidirectional roads.

#### Directed Graph (DiGraph)

^9112f8

- A directed graph or digraph is a graph in which *edges have orientations*. 
	- For example, the edge (u, v) is the edge from node u to node v.
- Gift example:
	- ![Pasted image 20230717120913.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717120913.png)
		- Nodes represent people
		- An edge (u,v) could represent that person u bought person v a gift.
		- Incoming edge represents receiving a gift
		- Outgoing edge represents giving a gift.

``#### Weighed Graphs

^cdaf9b

- Many graphs can have edges that contain a certain weight to represent an arbitrary value such as cost, distance, quantity, etc...
- Weighted graphs come in undirected and directed flavors.

	![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717121318.png)
- Usually an edge is denoted as a triplet (u,v,w) and specify whether the graph is directed or undirected.

### Special Graphs

^7f2022

#### Trees

^d3c78b

- A tree is an undirected connected graph with no cycles.
	- Equivalent definition, it is a connected graph with N nodes and N-1 edges.

#### Rooted Tree

^78b9a8

- A **rooted tree** is a tree with a designated root node where every edge either points away from or towards the root node. 
- When edges point away from the root the graph is called an *arborescence (out-tree)* and *anti-arborescence (in-tree)* otherwise.

#### Directed Acyclic Graphs(DAGs)

^53fe08

- DAGs are directed graphs with no cycles. 
- These graphs play an important role in representing structures with dependencies.
- Several efficient algorithms exist to operates on DAGs. 
	- how to find shortest path
	- topological ordering of nodes
- Many applications uses DAGs schedulers, compilers and etc.
- All out-trees are DAGs but not all DAGs are out-trees.

#### Bipartite Graphs

^617fd4

- A bipartite graph is one whose vertices can be split into two independent groups U, V such that every edge connects between U and V.
- Other definitions exist such as: 
	- The graph is two colourable or 
	- There is no odd length cycle.
- Example problems:
	- What is the maximum matching we can create on a bipartite graph
	- Suppose white nodes are jobs, and red nodes are people, how many people can be matched to jobs?
- Bipartite graphs play a critical role in the field of network flows.

#### Complete Graphs

^b63c3f

- A complete graph is one where there is a unique edge between every pair of nodes.
- A complete graph with n vertices is denoted as the graph Kn.

![Pasted image 20230717122847.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717122847.png)
- If you want to test your algorithm for performance a complete graph is a easy way to start.

## Representing Graphs

^4e5031

-  Which sort of data structure are we using to represent our graphs on our computers
	- This can have a huge impact on performance.

#### Adjacency Matrix

^3f8d46

- A adjacency matrix m is a very simple way to represent a graph. 
- The idea is that the cell m\[i\]\[j\] represents the edge weight of going from node i to node j.
![Pasted image 20230717123305.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717123305.png)
- It is often assumed that the edge of going from a node to itself has a cost of zero. That's why the diagonal of the matrix is fully zero.

- PROS & CONS

![Pasted image 20230717123755.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717123755.png)
 - Dense means, graphs with a lot of edges.
 - Since it takes O($V^2$) space, graphs over 10000 nodes becomes infeasible very easily.
 - It requires O($V^2$) work for edges, which is usually fine for dense graphs, but not so for sparse graphs.

#### Adjacency List.

^44f06c

- The idea is that each nodes tracks its outgoing edges.
- An adjacency list is a way to represent a graph as a map from nodes to lists of edges.

![Pasted image 20230717125157.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717125157.png)
![Pasted image 20230717125249.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717125249.png)
- We only keep track of where we are going and the cost of the travel.

- PROS & CONS
![Pasted image 20230717125408.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717125408.png)
- Great for sparse graphs, because you only allocate the edges you use unlike the adjacency matrix.
	- This means it is also efficient when iterating over all the edges.
- The main disadvantage is  lesser space efficient for denser graphs.
	- another subtle disadvantage is that you need O(E) time to access a specific edge, but this is rarely the case.

#### Edge List

^54ebd1

- An edge list is a way to represent a graph simply as an unordered list of edges.
	- Assume the notation for any triplet (u,v,w) means: ‚Äúthe cost from node u to node v is w‚Äù
	
![Pasted image 20230717125819.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717125819.png)
- This representation is seldomly used because it lacks structure.
	- only pratical in a handful of algorithms

- PROS & CONS

![Pasted image 20230717130018.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230717130018.png)
