# Dijkstra's Shortest Path
- Given a *non-negative weighted* graph G, and a source vertex, S, the algorithm returns the **shortest path** from S to any of the other vertices.
	- In order words, it is a. *Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP)* algorithm
- Depending on how the algorithm is implemented and what data structures are used, the time complexity is typically **O(E\*log(V))*** which is competitive against other shortest path algorithms.
 - Which graphs can we run Dijsktra's Algorithm on?
	 - One constraint is the graph must only contain non-negative edge weights.
		 - This constraint is imposed to ensure that once a node has been visited its optimal distance can't be improved.
		 - This property is especially important because it enables Dijsktra's algorithm to act in a *greedy* manner by always selecting the next promising node (min distance node)

## Example
- Here is a weighted graph:
	![Pasted image 20230720190046.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230720190046.png)
- In Dijsktra's algorithm, there are 2 kinds of *EXPLORED* and *UNEXPLORED*
- We keep track of  $V^{DP}$ 
	- V stands for the vertex under consideration
	- D stands for the minimum distance from the source vertex to vertex V.
		- The path used must only have the explored vertices.
	- P stands for the parent of the vertex V in the path.
		- The path used must only include explored vertices.

### Executing the Dijsktra's Algorithm
-  Here we construct our table for explored and unexplored vertices

	| EXPLORED                        | UNEXPLORED                                              | EXPLANATION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
	| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
	|                                 | $S^{\infty}$   $A^{\infty}$  $B^{\infty}$  $C^{\infty}$ | Initially all the vertices min distance is initialized to $\infty$                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
	|                                 | $S^{0}$   $A^{\infty}$  $B^{\infty}$  $C^{\infty}$      | The distance from S to itself   is zero, because we are already there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
	| $S^{0}$                         | $A^{1S}$  $B^{3S}$  $C^{\infty}$                        | We got  $S^{0}$    to explored region, because that is the minimum among the unexplored from the previous row, the distance from S to A is 1 (which is smaller than infinity) and parent of A is S, therefore we write  $A^{1S}$,  the same goes for $B^{3S}$                                                                                                  |
	| $S^{0}$   $A^{1S}$              | $B^{2A}$  $C^{11A}$                                     | Since the minimum among the unexplored vertices was $A^{1S}$, we transfer it to the explored region. Then we look for the distance from A to B (from the last added element) to all nodes in the unexplored region. Since the distance from A to B is 2 which smaller than current $B^{3S}$, therefore we updated it to $B^{2A}$ , the same goes for $C^{11A}$ |
	| $S^{0}$   $A^{1S}$     $B^{2A}$ | $C^{6B}$                                                | Since the minimum among the unexplored was $B^{2A}$, we moved it to the explored region.    And now we can reach to C from B in 6 steps so we update $C^{11A}$ to $C^{6B}$. |
	|    $S^{0}$   $A^{1S}$  $B^{2A}$  $C^{6B}$                        |                                                        |   Since the minimum was C, we moved to explored region, and there are no more un-explored vertices. So the algorithm ends.     |

### Reconstructing the shortest paths.
- Now we can determine the shortest paths from S to any other node by looking at our explored vertex array.
	- From S,
	- To A: 
		- $A^{1S}$, we can back track from A to S in 1 step so the path is A->S (distance : 1)
	- To B:
		- $B^{2A}$ , we back track to S in 2 steps. B->A->S (distance:2)
	- To C:
		- $C^{6B}$, we back track to S in 6 steps. C->B->A->S (distance: 6)



## Another Example

- Here is our table to execute the Dijsktra's algorithm from the starting vertex A

- Here are the paths from A 
	- to D : D->A (distance 1)
	- to B :  B->A (distance 2)
	- to C : C->D->A (distance 3)
	- to E : E->D->A (distance 3)
	- to G : G->D->A (distance 5)
	- to F :  F->G->D->A (distance 6) 


## Pseudo-Code
```Julia
function dijsktra(graph, start)
	explored = []
	unexplored = empty priority queue
	#augments each vertex with a min-dist & parent link
	for(vert in graph.vertices)
		augmented = augment(vert)
		augmented.dist   = INFINITY
		augmented.parent = NON_EXISTENT
		#since we are already there 
		if(vert.id == start.id)
			augmented.dist = 0
		end
		unexplored.push(augmented)
	end
	
	while(unexplored is not empty)
		#picks the vertex with min distance
		min = unexplored.poll()
		# adds it to the explored
		explored.add(min)
		# checks its edges
		for(edge : graph[min.id])
			#takes O(1) time because this is an IPQ
			augmented = find(edge.to, unexplored)
			#if found in unexplored, this way we don't explore already explored nodes.
			 if(augmented)
				newDist = min.dist + edge.cost
				if (newDist < augmented.dist )
					#takes O(logV)
					pq.decreaseKey(augmented,newDist)
					augmented.parent = min
				end
			 end
		end
	end
	#returns the augmented explored vertices.
	return explored
end

function reconstruct(explored)
	paths = []
	for(vertex in explored)
		path =[ vertex ]
		while(exists(vertex.parent))
			path.addFront(vertex.parent)
			vertex = vertex.parent
		end
		paths.insert(path)
	end
	return paths
end

```

- Notes:
	- In practice, most standard libraries don't support the *decrease key* operation for PQs. 
	- A way to get around this s to add a new vertex with best distance every time we update the distance to a node.
		- As a result, it is possible to have duplicate node indices in the PQ.
		- This is not ideal, but inserting a new vertex in **O(log(n))** is much faster than
			- searching for the key in the PQ which takes **O(n)**
			- Because the heap is sorted by the keys values (min dist), not the keys themselves (not vertex id).


## Optimizations

### Early Stopping
- Suppose you know the destination node you are trying to reach is 'e' and you start at node 's'.
	- Do you still need to visit every node in the graph?
	 ![Pasted image 20230721152417.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230721152417.png)
	- The answer is:
		- If your graph has a negative edge. Then yes, you have to.
		- If not, then once you visited the node, then u r done, Dijkstra's algorithm also takes advantage of this fact by always choosing the most promising node from the unexplored list.
			- Once it is included in the explored list, the shortest path to this node will not change as the future nodes are visited.
 - The only thing you need to do is to check min node is equal to end node.
	 - This is a very substantial speed up.

### Implementation Techniques
- As we said before, if your heap doesn't have decreaseKey, and inserts duplicate values.
	- Because it is more efficient to insert a new vertex in *O(log(n))* than it is to update an existing key value in *O(n)*
	- However for dense graphs, this is inefficient, we end up with several stale outdated vertices values in our PQ.
- We can fix this problem by avoiding the duplicate vertex values and achieve efficient value updates in *O(log(n))* time with the help of **Indexed Priority Queues (IPQ)**
	- IPQ allows us to access the elements in *O(1) time instead of O(n)*
	- And we do the heapify operation in *O(log(n))*
	- This is our approach in the code.!!!

### D-ary Heap Optimization
- So far, we have been using PQs based binary heaps.
- When executing Dijsktra's algorithm, especially on dense graphs, there are a lot more updates (i.e decreaseKey operations) than there are dequeue (poll) operations.
- A **D-Ary Heap** is a heap variant in which each node has D children instead of 2 children in a binary heap.
	- This speeds up decrease key operations at the expense of more costly removals.

- Here is a D=4 ary heap:
	![Pasted image 20230721161119.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230721161119.png)

- Suppose we want to perform an update operation
	- let's say we want to update the node with index 6 to have a new shortest distance of 1. (aka decreaseKey(6,1))
	- Assuming we have an Indexed D-ary Heap we can update the vertex's value in O(1) time using the map(hence it is indexed), but we still need to bubble it up.

		![Pasted image 20230721161759.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230721161759.png)
		- Bubble up
		![Pasted image 20230721161842.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230721161842.png)
		- Bubble up, the whole update took only 2 operations because the heap was very wide instead of being deep.
		![Pasted image 20230721161903.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230721161903.png)

	 - In contrast suppose we want to remove the root node.
		 ![Pasted image 20230721162501.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230721162501.png)

		- We have swap the root with the bottom -right node
		![Pasted image 20230721162738.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230721162738.png)
		- and start down bubbling by swapping with the minimum one
		![Pasted image 20230721162857.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230721162857.png)
		- bubble down again.
		![Pasted image 20230721163217.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230721163217.png)
	
- What is the optimal D-ary heap degree to maximize performance of Dijkstra's algorithm?
	- In general **D = E/V** is the best degree to use balance removals against decreaseKey operations improving Dijsktra's time complexity to O(E \* $log_{E/V}(V)$) which is much better especially for dense graphs which has a lot of decreaseKey Operations.

### Fibonacci Heaps 
- Current stat of the art as of now is the Fibonacci heap which gives Dijsktra's algorithm a time complexity of O(E + Vlog(V))
- However, in practice, Fibonacci heaps are very *diffucult to implement* and have a *large enough constant amortized overhead* to make them impractical unless your graph is quite large.
