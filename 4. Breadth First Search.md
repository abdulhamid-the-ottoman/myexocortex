# Breadth First Search
- The Breadth First Search (BFS) is another fundamental traversal algorithm used to explore all the edges and vertices of the graph
	- It runs with a time complexity of **O(V+E)** and is often used as a building block in other algorithms.
- In BFS, we are going to identify levels, such as level 0, level 1, level 2...
	- we are going to visit all the vertices at level 0, then level 1 and .... level n
	- explore neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors
- The BFS algorithm is particularly useful for one thing: *finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs.*
## Algorithm

^52a950

- Here is how we do Breadth First Search
	- Initially,
		- all vertices are unvisited
		- all edges are undiscovered
	- Choose an arbitrary start vertex
		- Add it to the level queue and visit it.
		- For all the edges incident on the current vertex
			- if there is undiscovered edges
				- Check whether the leading vertex is visited?
					- Mark the traversed edge as CROSS edge
				- Check whether the leading vertex is unvisited?
					- Mark the traversed edge as DISCOVERED edge
					- Visit the vertex
					- Add it to the level queue for next level.
			- No undiscovered edges
				- Go to the next vertex in the queue.

- Initially all the vertices are unvisited and all the edges are undiscovered.

- We choose an arbitrary start vertex and add it to level queue
	- we put a tag in the picture above saying level 0.

- We traverse along the undiscovered edges and visit the end vertices.
	- B, C, D were unvisited, so we visited them and add them to the level queue.
	- and the edges between A and these vertices must be marked as discovered edges.

- Once there are no more undiscovered edges are present from the current vertex A, we go to the next level. 
	- get the first element from the level queue, which is vertex B.

- Once we follow the undiscovered edges from the current vertex B
	- we reach vertex C, which is an already visited vertex, so we mark the edge in between as cross edge
	- we reach vertex E, visit it, and mark the edge in between as discovered.

- Since there were no more undiscovered edges from B, we have to pop the level queue to get the next element present
	- we repeat what we have done so far.

## Pseudo Code

```C++
BFS(G){
   for all v in V(G){
	   v.label = UNVISITED;
   }

   for all e in E(G){
	   e.label = UNDISCOVERED;
   }

   for all s in V(G){
	   if (s.label == UNVISITED){
		   visit(s,G)
	   }
   }
}

visit(s,G){
	queue.add(s)
	while(queue is not empty){
		int size = queue.size();
		while(size > 0){
			cv = queue.pop();
			cv.label = VISITED;
			for all e in cv.incidentEdges{
				if(e.label == UNDISCOVERED){
					w = adj_vertex(cv,e);
					if(w.label == VISITED){
						e.label = CROSS_EDGE;
					}
					if(w.label == UNVISITED){
						e.label = DISCOVERED;
						w.label = VISITED;
						queue.push(w);
					}
				}
			}
			size--;
		}
	}
}

## Shortest path in a unweighted graph.

^2c9088

- We can traverse the graph in BFS order from an start vertex and keep track of the parent of the nodes visited until we reach our destination node.
- Once we have that, we can reconstruct the path from start to the end.

### Algorithm
![Pasted image 20230718130508.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230718130508.png)

#### Execute a breadth first search

#### Reconstruct the path
![Pasted image 20230718130904.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230718130904.png)

### Solve Function
![Pasted image 20230718130610.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230718130610.png)

#### An array for reconstructing the shortest path
![Pasted image 20230718131327.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230718131327.png)
- This prev array tracks who the parent of node i is. and initialized to null for every vertex
![Pasted image 20230718131802.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230718131802.png)
- here the prev array is updated by assigning the parent node of a particular node in visiting the neighbors of the current vertex.

#### Then we reconstruct the path

## Grids As Graphs

^9dea1a

- Many problems in graph theory can be represented using a grid.
- Grids are a form of *implicit graph* because we can determine a node's neighbors based on our location within the grid.

- Finding a path through a grid is solving the maze:
![Pasted image 20230718132354.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230718132354.png)

- Or you are a person trying to navigate your way through obstacles to get to a location:

### Common Approach For Grids
- First convert the grid to a familiar format such as an *adjacency list/matrix*
- This may not always be the most efficient technique but we will get to that.

#### How can we represent a grid as both an adjacency matrix  and list?
- Here is our simple empty grid.
	![100](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230718132819.png)
- First we label the cells in the grid with numbers \[0,n\)  where n = \#rows x \#columns![100](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230718132955.png)
- Then we construct an adjacency list and matrix using this labelling.
![Pasted image 20230718133227.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230718133227.png)
- Assuming the grid is unweighted and cells connect left, right, up and down.
- since we have 6 cells, we need a 6x6 adjacency matrix.


#### Running Graph Algorithms
- Once we have an adjacency list/matrix we can run whatever specialized graph algorithm to solve our problem such as:
	- shortest path
	- connected components
- Transformations between graph representations can usually be avoided due to the structure/nature of a grid.
	- This can be achieved using row vectors such as \[0,1\], \[-1,-1\]
	- ![Pasted image 20230718133748.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230718133748.png)
	- These row vectors make it very easy to access neighboring cells from the current row-column position.

## Dungeon Problem

^257e45

-  You are trapped in a 2D dungeon and need to find the quickest way out!
- The dungeon is composed of unit cubes which may or may not be filled with rocks
- It takes a minute to move one unit north, south, east , west
- You can't move diagonally and the maze is surrounded by solid rock by all sides.
- Is an escape possible? If yes, how long will it take?

### The problem
  
 ![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230718163052.png)
	 - The dungeon has a size of R x C
	 - You start at cell 'S' and there's an exit at cell 'E'
	 - A cell full of rock is indicated by a #
	 - Empty cells are represented by a '.'

### The Solution
- We start running a BFS from the start node
- We avoid the rock cells
- And we must be mindful of when we reached the end node 'E'.

- Let's start at node (0,0) and add it to the queue.
![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230718163921.png)

- Lets continue
![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230718164010.png)

![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230718164043.png)

- It continues doing the BFS, and finally reaches the final configuration:
![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230718164144.png)

- Now we have to reconstruct the path.
