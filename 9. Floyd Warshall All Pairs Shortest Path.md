# Floyd Warshall All Pairs Shortest Path

- In graph theory, the Floyd-Warshall (FW) algorithm is an **All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) algorithm**.
	- This means it can the the shortest path between all pairs of nodes
- The time complexity to run FW is *O($V^3$)* which is *ideal for graphs no larger than couple hundred nodes*

## Comparison of SP Algorithms

## Graph Setup
- With FW, the *optimal way to represent our graph is with a 2D adjacency matrix m* where cell m\[i\]\[j\] represents the edge weight of going from node i to node j
- Here is an example:
	![Pasted image 20230722125519.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722125519.png)
	- The distance from a node to itself is zero. That's why the diagonal is all zero.
	
- When there is no edge from node i to node j, then set the edge value for m\[i\]\[j\] to be positive infinity.

	- If your programming language doesn't support a special constant for +$\infty$ such that $\infty$ + $\infty$ = $\infty$ and $\infty$ + x = $\infty$ , then avoid using $2^{31} - 1$ as infinity. 
		- Because this may cause integer overflow; prefer to use a large constant.

## The Main Idea
 - The main idea behind FW algorithm is *to gradually build up all intermediate routes between nodes i and node j* to find the optimal path.

### Basic Idea I
 - Suppose our adjacency matrix tells us that the distance from node a to node b is :  **m\[a\]\[b\] = 11**
		 ![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722130608.png)
 -  Suppose there exists a third node, c. If
	 - m\[a\]\[c\] + m\[c\]\[b\] < m\[a\]\[b\] then it's better to route through c!
		   ![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722130759.png)

### Basic Idea II
- The goal of Floyd-Warshall is to eventually consider going through all possible intermediate nodes on paths of different lengths.
- Here, the optimal path  from node a to node b which is first going to C, then going from C to B. 
	- But in the process, we actually route through another node because we already computed the optimal path from C to B. (2 intermediate nodes)
		![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722154424.png)
- Here is another one, optimal path which uses 2 more intermediate nodes other than C
		![400](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230722155032.png)
- Here is another optimal path which uses more intermediate nodes.

## How do we compute all intermediate paths?
- The answer is that we will use  dynamic programming to cache previous optimal solutions.
- Let dist(u,v,r) = shortest path distance from u to v using vertices only indexed from 1 to r.
	![Pasted image 20230723061808.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723061808.png)
	- Here in the figure above shown dist(2,5,4). length of the shortest path from u = 2 to v=5 can only use nodes 1,2,3,4 (at most r=4 intermediate nodes)

- Since we are calculating all pairs, we will end up with a `n x n x n`  matrix which holds all the values for min distance.
	- let's call this array dp\[\r\]\[u\]\[v\] = shortest path from node u to node v routing through nodes {0,1,...,r-1,r}
	- Specifically we are after dp\[n-1\]. This is 2D matrix which holds shortest paths between every pair of vertices using vertices indexed from 1 to n-1

## How do we populate this array?
- dist(u,v,r) = shortest path distance from node u to node v using vertices only index from 1 to r
	- it is easy when u = v, that means we are already at that node, so distance between them is 0.
	- r = 0, means when there is no node  between node u and node v, which corresponds to direct edge between node u and node v, w(u->v)
		![Pasted image 20230723063435.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723063435.png)

      - W. at happens if r > 0 ?
	      - **Case 1 :**  Vertex r is not in the  shortest path from node u to node v. In this case, we can say that dist(u,v,r) = dist(u,v,r-1) as shown in the example below.
	      ![Pasted image 20230723064001.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723064001.png)
	     - Here in the figure above shown, dist(1,5,3) = shortest path from node 1 to node 5 using vertices {1,2,3} is the same as dist(1,5,2) = shortest path from node 1 to node 5 using vertices {1,2}
		 - Here it is drawn more abstractly
		 ![Pasted image 20230723072839.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723072839.png)
		 - As a result, first part of our recurrence equation
		![Pasted image 20230723064408.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723064408.png)
		- What fills the *question mark* in the equation above?
			- This is our case 2, where vertex r is in the shortest path from node u to node v.
			![Pasted image 20230723073730.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723073730.png)
			- The path from node u to node r is the shortest path from u to r that uses intermediate vertices {1,2,....,r-1}
			- The path from node r to node v is the shortest path from r to v using  intermediate nodes vertices {1,2,..., r-1}
			- Thus;
				- dist(u,v,r) = dist(u,r,r-1) + dist(r,v,r-1)
				
			- Combining these 3 cases:
			![Pasted image 20230723065237.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723065237.png)

## Complexity
- Here is the full recurrence relation
![Pasted image 20230723065525.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723065525.png)
- The above equation is only an assertion of a property (it is not an algorithm)
- The equation really says "optimality for size r" can be expressed in terms of "optimality for size r-1".
- The overall optimal cost of going from node u to v is : dist(u,v,n-1) for n vertices.
	- Thus we have to compute this for all (u,v) pairs.
	- Understand that this only gives you the optimal cost, not the actual paths.

- To calculate we can use an iterative approach:
    - First, compute dp\[r\]\[u\]\[\v\] for r = 0 
    - Then, use that to compute dp\[1\]\[u\]\[\v\]
    - ...
    - Finally, use dp\[n-2\]\[u\]\[\v\] compute dp\[n-1\]\[u\]\[\v\].
    ![Pasted image 20230723075140.png](./40-referenceVAULTS/Resource%20Library/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230723075140.png)
    - This means there are $n^2$ pairs , and r=n-1 ways of selecting of intermediate nodes so in total $n^2$ * n-1 resulting in O($n^3$) time.
- Currently we are using **O($n^3$)** memory since our memo table `dp` has one dimension for each of u,v, and r.
	- Notice that we will be looping over r starting from 0, then 1, 2 ... and so forth.
	- The important thing to note here is that previous result builds off the last since we need state r-1 to compute r
		- It is possible to compute *the solution for r in-place* saving us a dimension of memory an reducing the space complexity to **O($n^2$)**

## Pseudo-Code
```Julia
n  = size of the adjacency matrix
dp = the memo table that will contain APSP soln
next = matrix used to reconstruct shortest paths, inited to nulls
function FW(adj_mat)
	#case r = 0 
	for u  =  0 to n-1 :
		for v = 0 to n-1 :
			#note that if there is no direct edge, +infinity
			#case r = 0
			dp[u][v] = adj_mat[u][v]
			#you are going to j, otherwise it is null 
			if adj_mat[u][v] != +infinity :
				#first index is where you are currently at.
				#second index begin your destination
				next[u][v] = v
		end
	end
	#case r > 0
	for r = 0 to n-1 :
		for u= 0 to n-1 :
			for v = 0 to n-1 :
				if  dp[u][r] + dp[r][v] < dp[u][v]:
					dp[u][v] = dp[u][r] + dp[r][v]
					next[u][v] = next[u][r] # you are going over r
				end
			end
		end
	end

	#detect and propagate negative cycles, this is an optinal step.
	propagateNegativeCycles(dp,n)

	return dp
end

function propagateNegativeCycles(dp,n):
	#Execute FW APSP algorithm a second time but 
	#this time if the distance can be improved
	#set the distance to be -infinity
	#Every edge (i,j) marked with -infinity is either
	#part of or reachable from a negative cycle
	for r = 0 to n-1:
		for u = 0 to n-1:
			for v = 0 to n-1:
				if  dp[u][r] + dp[r][v] < dp[u][v]:
					dp[u][v] = -INFINITY
					next[u][v] = -1 # for indicating reachable or part of
				end
			end
		end
	end
end

# returns the shortest path between start and end nodes.
# returns null if path is effected by a negative cycle. 
function reconstructPath(stv, endv)
	path = 
	#check from the dp array, if there is no path between 2 nodes, directly return empty path
	if dp[stv][endv] == +INFINITY :
		return path
	end
	#start and follow the nodes placed in next array
	at = stv
	for(; at != endv ; at = next[at][endv]) :
		#this means optimal node has encountered a red node (part of negative cycle), path is trapped in a negative cycle.
		if at == -1:
			return null
		end
		path.add(at)
	end
	if next[at][endv] == -1:
		return null
	end
	path.add(endv)
	return path
end
```
