## Definitions
- A **requirement** is a *specific* thing your *system* has to *do* to work *correctly*.
	- "Specificity" requires a *single thing* that you can *test* whether you have actually fulfilled it.
	- "System" is the complete *app* or *project* you are working on.
	- "Do" as in what your system has to do/
	-  Remember the *customer* decides when a system works correctly.
		- Meaning, even if they forget, you have to figure out what they didn't tell you.
- In other words, "**requirement**" is a *singular need* detailing what a particular product or service should *be* or *do*
## Requirements
- The best way to get good requirements is to understand what a system is supposed to do.
